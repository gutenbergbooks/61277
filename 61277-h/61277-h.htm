<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">This</span> is the tenth volume of the <i>History of the
Reformation of the Sixteenth Century</i>, and the fifth of
the Second Series. The first series described the
history of that great epoch from its commencement
down to the Confession of Augsburg (1530). The
second will include the years intervening between
that period and the triumph of the Reformation in
various parts of Europe. It is not always easy to fix
the latter limit, which varies according to locality.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a rule laid down by the author in his
first volume sensibly limits the work he has undertaken.
'The history of one of the greatest revolutions
that has ever been accomplished in human
affairs, and not the history of a mere party, is the
object of the present undertaking. The history of
the Reformation is distinct from that of Protestantism.'
One or two volumes coming, God willing,
after this one will bring it to a conclusion. The
author divided the history into two series for the
convenience of the public, but he does not separate
them. Together they form a single work.</p>

<p>The course that he will probably pursue in future
will better express the unity of the great event which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">{iv}</a></span>
has made the sixteenth century famous. Streams at
first flow apart; they afterwards unite with each
other in succession and form a single river. There
comes a moment when the waters undergo the law of
concentration: the same phenomenon is manifested
in a history like ours. After following up successively
the facts of the Reformation in Germany,
German Switzerland, France, England, Western
Switzerland and elsewhere, we shall concentrate our
narrative a little, and present the progress of the
great transformation in a single picture.</p>

<p>New countries and new men will come before us.
In our next volume we shall travel through Scotland,
Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, and other parts of
Europe, retracing the great features of their religious
history. We shall even return to Luther and
Melanchthon, whose society is at once so healthy and
so pleasant; and also see Calvin at his work in
Geneva.</p>

<p>One circumstance, besides that already indicated,
warns the author to restrict his labor, and might
suddenly interrupt it. Time is growing short for him,
and he cannot complete his work without the aid of
Him who is the master of our days.</p>

<p>This volume begins with England. A faithful
history of the Reformation is now perhaps more
necessary to that country than to any other. The
general opinion on the Continent, excepting that of
the blind partisans of popery, is that the cause of
Reform is won, and that there is no need to defend
it. Strange to say this is not entirely true with
regard to England—a country so dear to the friends
of truth and liberty. Nay, even among Anglican
ministers, a party has been formed enthusiastic in
behalf of rites, sacerdotal vestments, and superstitious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">{v}</a></span>
Roman doctrines, and violent in their attacks upon
the Reformation. The excesses in which some of its
members have indulged are unprecedented. One of
them has instituted a comparison between the Reformers
and the leaders during the Reign of Terror—Danton,
Marat, and Robespierre, for instance—and
declares the superiority of the latter.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span>
'The Reformation,'
says this Anglican priest in another place,
'was not a Pentecost; I regard it as a Deluge, an act
of divine vengeance.' In the presence of such opinions
and of others which, though less marked, are not
less fatal, the history of the Reformation may furnish
some wholesome lessons.</p>

<p>The history of England is succeeded in this volume
by a narrative of the events which led to the triumph
of the Reformation in Geneva. That history ought
to interest the Protestants of every country, the little
city having afterwards played so considerable a part
in the propagation of evangelical truth and in the
struggles of Protestantism with Popery.</p>

<p>For the purpose of his narrative, the author has
continued to consult the most authentic sources:
original documents, letters written by the persons of
whom this history speaks or by their contemporaries,
and the chronicles, annals, and books published at
that epoch. He has made use of such collections of
documents as have been printed; frequently he has
had recourse to MSS. of the period which have not
yet been published.</p>

<p>We live in a literary age when criticism sways the
sceptre. Criticism is good and necessary: it purifies
history and clears the paths to the palace of truth.
But if dogmatic epochs have their excesses, critical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">{vi}</a></span>
epochs have theirs also. It was said a long while
ago that 'those who run too hastily after truth shoot
beyond it.' The men who desire to renovate history
are like those who desire to renovate cities. The
latter begin by pulling down a few ugly houses which
disfigure the neighborhood and impede the traffic;
but at last they lay their hands on solid and useful
edifices, buildings whose destruction is regretted by
every one. Wise men will, in critical ages, take
moderation and equity for their rule. These have
often been wanting in recent days. There is a criticism
called by the Germans <i>hypercriticism</i>, which not
only denies what is false, but even what is true. The
Holy Scriptures have been the special object of its
attack. It has denied the authenticity of the writings
of St. John, St. Paul, Isaiah and other sacred
writers, and the truth of many of the facts which they
record. If the sacred books have not been spared
by this criticism, writings purely human, the facts of
history, have not escaped unassailed. There have
been numerous instances of this in Germany and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Several facts which belong to the history of the
Reformation of France and French Switzerland have
been recently called in question both in reviews and
pamphlets. The author has felt it his duty to prove
the historical reality of his statements, not only in
the Preface to the French edition of this volume, but
in the February Number of the <i>Revue Chrétienne</i>
(1869) published in Paris by M. Meyrueis. He has
not thought it necessary to give these details in the
English edition, because the statements which called
them forth are unknown in England. It will be
sufficient to indicate the principal points which have
been denied with too much precipitancy, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">{vii}</a></span>
correctness of which the author has proved by the
soundest demonstration.</p>

<p>The first fact relates to Le Fèvre of Etaples. The
author stated in his History that that theologian, the
writer of a remarkable translation of the Holy Scriptures
into French, had taught the great doctrine of
the Reformation—justification by faith through grace—as
early as 1512, that is to say, four or five years
before Luther. This having been disputed, the
author proved it by the existence of Le Fèvre's <i>Commentary
on the Epistles of St. Paul</i> published in 1512,
in which that doctrine is distinctly taught, and which
is preserved in the <i>Bibliothèque Impériale</i> at Paris.
He added other proofs derived from the writings of
Farel and Beza, as also from the learned critic
Richard Simon, Bayle, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The second fact concerns William Farel. The
author said in his History that this Reformer, the
most zealous evangelist of that period, had imbibed
the evangelical doctrines at Paris from the lessons of
his master, Le Fèvre of Etaples, and that he was
converted between 1512 and 1514—before the beginning
of the Reformation properly so called. That
point having been denied, the author proved it by
the positive declarations of Le Fèvre and Farel. The
latter says pointedly: 'This took place in the time of
Louis the Twelfth.' Now Louis XII. died in 1515.</p>

<p>The third fact relates to Thomas ab Hofen, the
friend of Zwingle, and deputy from Berne to Geneva
in 1527. The author wrote in his History that this
layman was, properly speaking, the first who labored
to spread the Gospel in Geneva. As that statement
had been impugned, the author proved it by the
German and Latin letters of Zwingle and of Ab
Hofen himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">{viii}</a></span></p>

<p>The fourth fact concerns Robert Olivetan, Calvin's
cousin, and author of the first translation of the Bible
into French. It has been doubted whether he was
tutor in the family of a Genevese councillor in 1532,
and whether he 'evangelized' at that time in Geneva.
The author proved his statement by the positive
testimony of the reformer Froment, in his <i>Actes et
Gestes de Genève</i>, and by extracts from the official
records of the Genevese Council. He has demonstrated
that Olivetan preceded in Geneva as a
preacher of the Gospel, not only Calvin but Farel
and Froment.</p>

<p>Lastly, the fifth fact relates to Calvin. A Genevese
writer denied a few years back that Calvin, when
returning from Italy, passed through Aosta, where
there exists, however, a monument erected to commemorate
his flight. The author hopes he has
proved that the universal opinion, which makes the
Reformer pass through that city, is well founded, and
that the contrary opinion has no weight.</p>

<p>This last point is discussed in the Preface to the
French edition of this volume: the four others are
examined at length in an article entitled <i>Critique
d'une Critique</i>, published in the <i>Revue Chrétienne</i> of
Paris.</p>

<p>There are individuals who, when they meet with
facts in a history that have not been previously
discussed in an archæological dissertation, or with
circumstances that had hitherto been unknown, immediately
imagine that such facts have no foundation.
This is a curious aberration. If an historian writes—not
according to second-hand authorities, but after
original materials—it is quite natural that he should
come upon things that have not been noticed before.
This has happened to the author of the <i>History of the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">{ix}</a></span>
<i>Reformation</i>. True history, no doubt, possesses coloring
and life; but it describes such events only as are
founded on the firm basis of truth.</p>

<p>There are writers at this day who carry their
archæological predilections further still and would
like to substitute chronicles for history, giving us a
body without a soul. But authors of distinguished
merit have protested against such an error.</p>

<p>A great critic, M. Sainte Beuve, says: 'There is
one kind of history founded on documentary evidence,
state papers, diplomatic transactions, and the correspondence
of ambassadors; and there is another kind
with quite a different aspect—moral history, written
by the actors and the eye-witnesses.'</p>

<p>An eminent man (Le Comte d'Haussonville) who
by his last work, <i>L'Eglise Romaine et le premier
Empire</i>, has taken an honorable position among historians,
indorses this judgment. 'M. Sainte Beuve
is right,' he says; 'the latter kind of history is the
best, by which I mean the most instructive, the most
profitable, the only one which serves to unseal the
eyes, open the understanding, combat deplorable
credulity, and avoid disagreeable mystifications.
What concerns us, is to know men, "by lifting the
curtain which hides them," according to the happy
expression of Saint-Simon.'</p>

<p>Another celebrated writer has said: 'Real history
appears only when the historian begins to distinguish,
across the gulf of time, the living and
acting man—the man endued with passions, the
creature of habit—with voice and physiognomy,
with gestures and dress, distinct and complete, like
the one from whom we have just parted in the
street. Language, Legislation, Catechisms, are abstract
things; the complete thing is the man acting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">{x}</a></span>
the visible corporeal man, who walks, fights, toils,
hates, and loves.</p>

<p>'Why is not history studied more closely? In
it men would find human life, domestic life with
its varied and dramatic scenes; the human heart
with its fiercest as well as its tenderest passions,
and moreover a sovereign charm—the charm of
reality.'</p>

<p>Lastly, we read in the studies of M. Daunou, one
of the most accredited masters of historical composition,
that 'history which is naturally <i>picturesque</i>
and <i>dramatic</i> has become in modern times <i>dull</i> and
<i>cold</i>, and no longer presents those living images
of men and things which ancient genius loved to
trace.'</p>

<p>History had freed herself from the restraint which
the Middle Ages had imposed on her, to prevent
her from speaking naturally and with life, as men
speak; and perhaps the lessons of the illustrious
academician and peer of France, whom we have just
quoted, may have contributed to this change. But
for some time observers have been asking whether
there is not reason to fear a return of the Middle
Ages; whether men are not again attempting to
fasten a gag on history. One might at times be
led to say that archæologists are of opinion that
history might be suppressed as a matter of luxury,
a useless ornament, and be replaced by documents,
diplomas, and extracts from registers strung
together.</p>

<p>Is it just that an historian should have the antiquaries
crying out against him from every side,
because, while keeping faithfully to documents, he
draws something from them that has life or light?
Is it just that when a character feels, moves, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">{xi}</a></span>
speaks, rejoices or grieves, the Areopagus should
declare him to be a fictitious being who could never
have existed, and a pure product of the imagination?
You believe that our ancestors were people like ourselves,
with hearts that beat with passion and grief.—By
no means; they were icy shades like those wandering
on the banks of the Styx. Hitherto men
had said: This being feels and moves, therefore
he lives; but according to the new school, life is
a fable. Nothing is authentic but what is wearisome.
A man and a history are not looked upon as real
living beings, unless they are colorless, stark, and
cold.</p>

<p>Of this we have had many instances. One time we
incurred this reproach: Your imagination, we were
told, invents features which give animation to the
subject, but about which you could know nothing.
The following passage was quoted: 'When Fryth
the reformer,' wrote the critic, 'was taken as a prisoner
on foot to the episcopal court at Croydon, you
say that "he had a calm and cheerful look, and the
rest of the journey was accomplished in pious and
agreeable conversation." How could you know that?'
the objector went on. 'Were you of the party to
see the appearance of his face?' We immediately
took down the eighth volume of Foxe's <i>Acts and Monuments</i>,
the appendix to which contains an account of
Fryth's journey written by an eye-witness. We
opened the book and found these words: 'And so
with a cheerful and merry countenance, he went
with them, spending the time in pleasant and
godly communication.' What we were charged
with having invented, was an almost literal transcript
of a document more than three hundred years
old.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">{xii}</a></span></p>

<p>If archæology were to be substituted for history,
we do not think the public would be overpleased
with the authors of the transformation. The investigations
of palæographers are not the edifice, but the
materials prepared for its construction. History is
above archæology, as the house is above its foundations.
The building raised by the architect is the
end. In it men find a pleasant dwelling-place, sheltered
from the inclemency of the seasons. But it is
a good thing to excavate, to dig out fragments of
rock from the bosom of the earth; it is advantageous,
when you build, to have stones, and good stones too.
The historian who sets little store by archæology betrays
a superficial mind; the archæologist who sets
little store by history betrays a mind whose cultivation
is still incomplete. But we need not fear this
movement; it has no chance of success. Real history
will never perish.</p>

<p>We insert this protest in the present volume, not
because of anything that may concern us personally;
but as this history has been favorably received, we
feel bound to prove that we have always followed
the most respectable authorities, and although liable
to error, we have conscientiously endeavored to give
a truthful narrative—true in its facts and in the spirit
by which it is animated.</p>

<p class="gap-above2">When will debates and contests cease? Happily
there is something in the world which the attacks of
men can neither batter down nor even shake, and
which is sufficient to give peace to the soul. The
holy words which the prophets of God have written
will exist for ever, because the Light of Life is in
them, and because from age to age many hearts,
longing for the highest blessings, have found, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span>
still find, in them everlasting life. They delight us,
not only on account of their divine origin, but because
they fully satisfy all the wants of our existence.
We say to this heavenly and living truth, which the
divine words reveal to us: I was naked and thou
didst clothe me. I was thirsty, and thou didst give
me to drink. I was hungry, and thou gavest me
meat. How is it that so many men, perishing with
thirst, do not come to these waters? Writers of
great power in pagan antiquity, such as Celsus, Porphyry,
and Julian, attacked Christianity in the early
ages, employing the same idle objections as are still
used in our days. They knew not that it contained
an imperishable strength. For eighteen hundred
years it has withstood all attacks, and since our
glorious Reformation it has received a new impulse.
The nations who cover the most distant seas with
their ships have scattered everywhere the seed of
God. Their footsteps have reached to the ends of
the world, and the crouching nations rise up at their
approach. Perhaps unbelief was never more common
in Europe among the lower strata of society; but at
the same time believers were never so numerous
throughout the world. <i>It is a great multitude which
no man can number.</i></p>

<p>And even were infidelity and atheism to increase
more and more, that should not lead us to forsake
Thee, thou Saviour of the world! If earthly wisdom
gives its votaries a light which scorches and wastes
the soul, Thou givest a light which uplifts, vivifies,
and delights. In the midst of struggles Thou implantest
peace in our hearts. In the depths of
sorrows Thou givest a powerful and living consolation.
At the approach of that death which is the
terror of men, Thou fillest our souls with the firm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span>
and lively hope of reaching, by the path of Thy
cross, life with Thee in the glorious and invisible
world. To whom should we go, O Christ? Thou
hast the words of eternal life, and we have believed
and have known, that Thou art the Christ, the Son
of the living God.</p>

 (<span class="smc">March and April, 1534.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> parliament of 1534 had greatly advanced the
cause of the Reformation. The voices of the most
enlightened men of England had been heard in it with
still greater power than in 1529; and accordingly an
historian,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span>
Sreferring to the meeting of 1534, speaks
of it as 'that great session.' Those enlightened men,
however, formed but a small minority, and among
them were many who, from a want of independence,
never voted on the side of liberty but when the king
authorized them. The epoch was a critical one for
the nation. It might as easily fall back to the pope, as
advance towards the Gospel. Hesitating between the
Middle Ages and modern times, it had to choose either
life or death. Would it make a vigorous effort and
reach those bracing heights, like travellers scaling the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
rugged sides of the Alps? England appeared too weak
for so daring a flight. The mass of the people seemed
chained by time-worn prejudices to the errors and
practices of Rome. The king no doubt had political
views which raised him above his age; but a slave to
his passions, and the docile disciple of scholasticism, he
detested a real Reformation and real liberty. The
clergy were superstitious, selfish, and excitable; and
the advisers of the crown knew no other rule than the
will of their master. By none of these powers, therefore,
could a transformation be accomplished. The
safety of England came from that sovereign hand, that
mysterious power, which was already stirring the
western world. The nation began to feel its energetic
impulse. A strange breeze seemed to be filling the sails
and driving the bark of the state towards the harbor,
notwithstanding the numerous shoals that lay around it.</p>

<p>The thought which at that time mainly engrossed
the minds of the most intelligent men of England—men
like Cranmer, Cromwell, and their friends—was the
necessity of throwing off the papal authority. They
believed that it was necessary to root out the foreign
and unwholesome weed, which had spread over the soil
of Britain, and tear it up so thoroughly that it could
never grow again. Parliament had declared that all
the powers exercised by the bishop of Rome in England
must cease and be transferred to the crown; and that
no one, not even the king, should apply to Rome for
any dispensation whatsoever. A prelate had preached
every Sunday at St. Paul's Cross that the pope was not
the head of the Church. On the other hand, the
pontiff, who was reckoning on Henry's promised explanations
and satisfactory propositions, seeing that the
messenger whom he expected from London did not
arrive, had solemnly condemned that prince on the 23rd
March, 1534.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>
But immediately startled at his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
boldness, Clement asked himself with agony how he
could repair this wrong and appease the king. He saw
it was impossible, and in the bitterness of his heart exclaimed:
'Alas! England is lost to us!'</p>

<p class="side">=THE KING CONDEMNED AT ROME.=</p>

<p>Two days after the famous consistory in which
Henry's condemnation had been pronounced, an English
courier entered Rome, still in a state of agitation and
trouble, and went straight to the papal palace. 'What
is his business?' people said; 'and what can give him
such boldness? The Englishman was bringing to the
ministers of the Vatican the long-expected act by which
the King of England declared himself prepared to enter
into an arrangement with the pope, provided the
cardinals of the imperial faction were excluded.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>
 The
messenger at the same time announced that Sir Edward
Carne and Revett, two envoys from Henry VIII., would
soon arrive to conclude the business.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span>
 Cardinal
Farnese, who erelong succeeded Clement under the title
of Paul III., and the more moderate prelates of the
sacred college, waited upon the pope at once, and
begged him to summon the consistory without delay.
It was just what Clement desired; but the imperialists,
more furious than ever, insisted on the confirmation of
the sentence condemning Henry, and spared no means
to ensure success. Monks went about repeating certain
stories which their English brethren sent them, and
which they furthermore exaggerated. They asserted
that the English people were about to rise in a body
against the king and throw themselves at the feet of the
holy father. The pope ratified the sentence, and the
consistory, taking one more step, ordered the emperor
to carry it out.</p>

<p>It has been said that a delay of two days was the
cause of the Reformation of England. That is a mistake.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
The Reformation came from the Holy Scriptures,
from God, from His mighty grace, and not from princes,
their passions, or delays. Even had the pontifical court
at last conceded to Henry the divorce he asked for, that
prince would probably not have renounced the rights
he had acquired, and which made him sole and true
monarch of England. Had he done so, it is doubtful
whether he was strong enough to check the Reformation.
The people were in motion. Christian truth had
reappeared among them: neither pontifical agitations
nor concessions could stop the rapid current that was
carrying them to the pure and living waters of the
Gospel.</p>

<p class="side">=DISMAY OF THE ENGLISH ENVOYS.=</p>

<p>However, Sir Edward Carne and William Revett,
Henry's envoys, arrived in Italy full of hope, and
pledged themselves (as they wrote to the king) to reconcile
England and the papacy 'in conformity to his
Highness's purpose.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span>
Having learnt on reaching
Bologna, that the bishop of Paris, who was instructed
to support them, was in that city, they hurried to him
to learn the exact state of affairs. The bishop was one
of those enlightened catholics who believed that the extreme
ultramontane party was exposing the papacy to
great danger, and who would have prevented schism in
the Church, by giving some satisfaction to Germany
and England. Hence the envoys from Henry VIII.
found the prelate dejected and embarrassed. 'All is
over,' he told them. 'The pope has pronounced sentence
against his Majesty.' Carne and Revett were
thunderstruck; the burden was too heavy for them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span>
'All our hopes have vanished in a moment,' they said.
Du Bellay assured them that he had spared no pains
likely to prevent so precipitate and imprudent an act on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
the part of a pope.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span>
'But the imperialists,' he said,
'moved heaven and earth, and constrained Clement VII.
to deliver a sentence in opposition to his own convictions.'
The ambassador of Francis I. added that there
was still one gleam of hope. 'Raincé, secretary to the
French embassy at Rome, with an oath, wished himself
at perdition,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span>
said Du Bellay rather coarsely, 'if our
holy father does not patch up all that has been
damaged.' The Englishmen desired to go to the pope
forthwith, in order to prevent the execution of the sentence.
'Do nothing of the kind,' said the French bishop.
'Do not go to Rome on any pretext whatsoever.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps Du Bellay wanted first to know what his master
thought of the matter. Carne, undecided what to
do, despatched a messenger to Henry VIII. to ask for
orders; and then, ten days later, wishing to do something,
he appealed from the bishop of Rome ill-informed
to the bishop of Rome better informed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PEOPLE AND CLERGY AGAINST ROME.=</p>

<p>When the King of England received his ambassador's
message, he could hardly restrain his anger. At the
very moment when he had made a concession, which
appeared to him the height of condescension, Rome
treated him with contempt and sacrificed him to Charles
V. Even the nation was aroused. The pope, it was said,
commissions a foreign prince to execute his decrees;
soldiers newly raised in Germany, and brimful of insults
and threats, are preparing to land in Great Britain!<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span>
National pride arrayed the people on the King's side.
Henry no longer hesitated; his offended honor demanded
reparation: a complete rupture alone could
satisfy it. He wrote a treatise entitled: 'On the power
of Christian kings over their Churches, against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
tyranny and horrible impiety of the pope.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span>
This book
against the pope, and the very different one that he had
formerly written against Luther, are the two claims of
this prince to theological renown. Consulting merely
his own interests, he threw himself now on one side,
now on the other. Many writers supported him. 'The
pope,' said Dr. Samsons, dean of the Chapel Royal, 'has
no more power in England than the Archbishop of Canterbury
in Rome. It was only by tacit consent that the
pope crept into the kingdom, but we intend to drive
him out now by express consent.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span>
The two houses of
parliament were almost unanimously of that opinion.
The privy council proposed to call upon the lord mayor
to see that anti-Romish doctrines were taught in every
house in London. Lastly, the people showed their
opposition after their fashion, indulging in games and
masquerades, in which a cardinal at one time, the pope
at another, were represented. To call a man a 'papist'
or 'a priest of the pope' was one of the greatest insults.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span>
Even the clergy declared against Rome. On
the 31st March the lower house of convocation discussed
whether the Roman pontiff had in England, according
to Scripture, a higher jurisdiction than any other
foreign bishop.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_16" id="Ref_16" href="#Foot_16">[16]</a></span>
Thirty-three voted in the negative,
only four in the affirmative. The king immediately
forwarded the same question to all the ecclesiastical
corporations of the kingdom. The friends of the
Gospel were filled with joy. The pope had made a
great mistake when, imitating the style of ancient Rome,
he had hurled the bolts of the Vatican, as Jupiter had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
in days of old launched the thunders of the Capitol. A
great revolution seemed to be working itself out unopposed
in this island, so long the slave of the Roman
pontiffs. There was just at this time nothing to be
feared from without: Charles V. was overwhelmed with
business; the King of Scotland was on better terms
with his uncle of England, and Francis I. was preparing
for a friendly interview with Henry VIII.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span>
And yet the danger had never been greater; but the
mine was discovered in March 1534, before the match
could be applied to it.</p>

<p>A dangerous political and clerical conspiracy had
been for some time silently organizing in the convents.
It was possible, no doubt, to find here and there in the
cloisters monks who were learned, pious, and loyal;
but the greater number were ignorant and fanatic, and
terribly alarmed at the dangers which threatened their
order. Their arrogance, grossness, and loose manners
irritated the most enlightened part of the nation; their
wealth, endowments, and luxury aroused the envy of
the nobility. A religious and social transformation was
taking place at this memorable epoch, and the monks
foresaw that they would be the first victims of the
revolution. Accordingly they were resolved to fight to
the uttermost, <i>pro aris et focis</i>, for their altars and
homes. But who was to take the first step in the
perilous enterprise—who to give the signal?</p>

<p>As in the days of the Maid of Orleans, it was a young
woman who grasped the trumpet and sounded the
charge. But if the first was a heroine, the other was an
ecstatic—nay, a fanatic.</p>

<p class="side">=ELIZABETH BARTON'S MIRACLES.=</p>

<p>There lived in the village of Aldington in Kent a
young woman of singular appearance. Although of an
age which is usually distinguished by a fresh and clear
complexion, her face was sallow and her eyes haggard.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
All of a sudden she would be seized with a trembling of
the whole body; she lost the use of her limbs and of
her understanding, uttered strange and incoherent
phrases, and fell at last stiff and lifeless to the ground.
She was, moreover, exemplary in her conduct. The
people declared her state to be miraculous, and Master,
the rector of the parish, a cunning and grasping priest,
noticing these epileptic attacks, resolved to take advantage
of them to acquire money and reputation. He suggested
to the poor sufferer that the extraordinary words
she uttered proceeded from the inspiration of Heaven,
and declared that she would be guilty if she kept secret
this wonderful work of God. A monk of Canterbury,
named Bocking, joined the priest with the intention of
turning the girl's disease to the profit of the Romish
party. They represented to Elizabeth Barton—such
was the name of the Kentish maiden—that the cause of
religion was exposed to great danger in England; that
it was intended to turnout the monks and priests; but
that God, whose hand defends His Church by the humblest
instruments, had raised her up in these
inauspicious days to uphold that holy ark, which king,
ministers, and parliament desired to throw down. Such
language pleased the girl: on the faith of the priests,
she regarded her attacks as divine transports; a feeling
of pride came over her; she accepted the part assigned
her. On a sudden her imagination kindled, she announced
that she had held communications with saints
and angels, even with Satan himself. Was this sheer
imposture or enthusiasm? There was, perhaps, a little
of both; but in her eyes, the end justified the means.
When speaking, she affected strange turns, unintelligible
figures, poetical language, and clothed her visions in
rude rhymes, which made the educated smile, but
helped to circulate her oracles among the people. Erelong
she set herself unscrupulously above the truth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
and inspired by a feverish energy, did not fear to excite
the people to bloodshed.</p>

<p>There was somewhere out in the fields in one part of
the parish, a wretched old chapel that had been long deserted,
and where a coarse image of the Virgin still remained.
Master determined to make it the scene of a
lucrative pilgrimage. He suggested the notion to Elizabeth
Barton, and erelong she gave out that the Virgin
would cure her of her disorder in that holy consecrated
edifice. She was carried thither with a certain pomp,
and placed devoutly before the image. Then a crisis
came upon her. Her tongue hung out of her mouth, her
eyes seemed starting from their sockets, and a hoarse
sepulchral voice was heard speaking of the terrors of
hell; and then, by a singular transformation, a sweet
and insinuating voice described the joys of paradise.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span>
At last the ecstasy ended, Elizabeth came to herself, declared
that she was perfectly cured, and announced that
God had ordered her to become a nun and to take Bocking
as her confessor. The prophecy of the Kentish
maiden touching her own disease being thus verified,
her reputation increased.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Barton's accomplices imagined that the new
prophetess required a wider stage than the fields of
Aldington, and hoped that, once established in the
ecclesiastical metropolis of England, she would see her
followers increase throughout the kingdom. Immediately
after her cure, the ventriloquist entered the convent
of the Holy Sepulchre at Canterbury, to which Bocking
belonged. Once in this primatial city, her oracles and her
miracles were multiplied. Sometimes in the middle of the
night, the door of her cell opened miraculously: it was
a call from God, inviting her to the chapel to converse
with Him. Sometimes a letter in golden characters was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
brought to her by an angel from heaven.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span>
The monks
kept a record of these wonders, these oracles; and selecting
some of them, Master laid the miraculous collection,
this bible of the fanatics, before Archbishop Warham.
The prelate, who appeared to believe in the nun's inspiration,
presented the document to the king, who
handed it to Sir Thomas More, and ordered the words
of the Kentish maiden to be carefully taken down and
communicated to him. In this Henry VIII. showed
probably more curiosity and distrust than credulity.</p>

<p>Elizabeth and her advisers were deceived, and thought
they might enter into a new phase, in which they hoped
to reap the reward of their imposture. The Aldington
girl passed from a purely religious to a political mission.
'Unhappily,' says an ultramontane writer, 'she quitted
heaven for earth, and busied herself with worldly things.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_20" id="Ref_20" href="#Foot_20">[20]</a></span>
This is what her advisers were aiming at. All, and especially
Friar Bocking, who contemplated restoring the
authority of the papacy—even were it necessary to their
end to take the king's life—began to denounce in her
presence Henry's tolerance of heresy and the new marriage
he desired to contract. Elizabeth eagerly joined
this factious opposition. 'If Henry marries Anne
Boleyn,' she told Bishop Fisher, 'in seven months' time
there will be no king in England.' The circle of her influence
at once grew wider. The Romish party united
with her. Abel, Queen Catherine's agent, entered into
the conspiracy; twice Elizabeth Barton appeared before
the pope's legates; Fisher supported her, and Sir
Thomas More, one of the most cultivated men of his
day, though at first little impressed in her favor, admitted
afterwards the truth of her foolish and guilty
revelations.</p>

<p class="side">=THE NUN BEFORE HENRY.=</p>

<p>One thing was yet wanting, and that was very essential
in the eyes of the supporters of the movement:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
Elizabeth must appear before Henry VIII. as Elijah
appeared before Ahab: they expected great results from
such an interview. At length they obtained permission,
and the Kentish maiden prepared herself for it by exercises
which over excited her. When brought into the
presence of the prince, she was at first silent and motionless,
but in a moment her eyes brightened and seemed
to flash fire; her mouth was drawn aside and stretched,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_21" id="Ref_21" href="#Foot_21">[21]</a></span>
while from her trembling lips there fell a string of incoherent
phrases. 'Satan is tormenting me for the sins
of my people,' she exclaimed, 'but our blessed Lady
shall deliver me by her mighty hand.... O times!
O manners!... Abominable heresies, impious innovations!...
King of England, beware that you touch not
the power of the holy Father.... Root out the new
doctrines.... Burn all over your kingdom the New
Testament in the vulgar tongue. Henry, forsake Anne
Boleyn and take back your wife Catherine.... If you
neglect these things, you shall not be king longer than
a month, and in God's eyes you will not be so even for
an hour. You shall die the death of a villain, and Mary,
the daughter of Catherine, shall wear your crown.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_22" id="Ref_22" href="#Foot_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>This noisy scene produced no effect on the king.
Henry, though prompt to punish, would not reply to
Elizabeth's nonsense, and was content to shrug his
shoulders. But the fanatical young woman was not
discouraged: if the king could not be converted, the
people must be roused. She repeated her threats in
the convents, castles, and villages of Kent, the theatre
of her frequent excursions. She varied them according
to circumstances. The king must fall: but at one time
she announced it would be by the hands of his subjects;
at another, of the priests; and at a third, by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
judgment of God. One point alone was unchanged in
her utterances: Henry Tudor must perish. Erelong,
like a prophetess lifted above the ordinary ministers of
God, she reprimanded even the sovereign pontiff himself.
She thought him too timid, and taking him to
task,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_23" id="Ref_23" href="#Foot_23">[23]</a></span>
declared that if he did not bring Henry's plans to
naught, 'the great stroke of God which then hung over
his head' would inevitably fall upon him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_24" id="Ref_24" href="#Foot_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>This boldness added to the number of her partisans.
Monks, nuns, and priests, knights, gentlemen, and
scholars, were carried away by her. Young folks
especially and men of no culture eagerly embraced this
mad cause. There were also men of distinction who
did not fear to become her defenders. Bishop Fisher
was gained over: he believed himself certain of the
young woman's piety. Being a man of melancholy
temperament and mystic tendency, a lover of the
marvellous, he thought that the soul of Elizabeth might
well have a supernatural intercourse with the Infinite
Being. He said in the House of Lords: 'How could I
anticipate deceit in a nun, to whose holiness so many
priests bore witness?' The Roman catholics triumphed.
A prophetess had risen up in England, like Deborah in
Israel.</p>

<p>One eminent and large-hearted catholic, Sir Thomas
More, had however some doubts; and the monks who
were Elizabeth's advisers set every engine at work to
win him over. During the Christmas of 1532, Father
Risby, a Franciscan of Canterbury, arrived at Chelsea
to pass the night there. After supper, he said: 'What
a holy woman this nun of Kent is! It is wonderful to
see all that God is doing through her.'—'I thank God
for it,' coldly answered More.—'By her mediation she
saved the cardinal's soul,' added the monk. The conversation
went no farther. Some time later a fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
attempt was made: Father Rich, a Franciscan of Richmond,
came and told More the story of the letter
written in letters of gold and brought by an angel.
'Well, father,' said the chancellor, 'I believe the nun of
Kent to be a virtuous woman, and that God is working
great things by her;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_25" id="Ref_25" href="#Foot_25">[25]</a></span>
but stories like that you have told
me are not part of our <i>Credo</i>, and before repeating them,
one should be very sure about them.' However, as the
clergy generally countenanced Elizabeth, More could
not bear the idea of forming a sect apart, and went to
see the prophetess at Sion monastery. She told him a
silly story of the devil turned into a bird.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_26" id="Ref_26" href="#Foot_26">[26]</a></span>
More was
satisfied to give her a double ducat and commend himself
to her prayers. The chancellor, like other noble
intellects among the catholics, was prepared to admit
certain superstitions; but he would have had the nun
keep in her religious sphere; he feared to see her
touch upon politics. 'Do not speak of the affairs of
princes,' he said to her. 'The relations which the late
Duke of Buckingham had with a holy monk were in
great part the cause of his death.' More had been
Chancellor of England, and perhaps feared the duke's
fate.</p>

<p class="side">=A CONSPIRACY FORMED.=</p>

<p>Elizabeth Barton did not profit by this lesson. She
again declared that, according to the revelations from
God, no one should deprive the Princess Mary of the
rights she derived through her birth, and predicted
her early accession. Father Goold immediately carried
the news to Catherine. The nun and her advisers,
who chided the pope only through their zeal for the
papacy, had communications with the nuncio; they
thought it necessary for him to join the conspiracy.
They agreed upon the course to be adopted: at a given
time, monks were to mingle with the people and excite a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
seditious movement.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_27" id="Ref_27" href="#Foot_27">[27]</a></span>
Elizabeth and her accomplices
called together such as were to be the instruments of
their criminal design. 'God has chosen you,' said the
nun to these friars, 'to restore the power of the Roman
pontiff in England.' The monks prepared for this meritorious
work by devout practices: they wore sackcloth
next their skin, they fastened iron chains round their
bodies, fasted, watched, and made long prayers. They
were seriously intent on disturbing the social order and
banishing the Word of God.</p>

<p>The violent Henry VIII.—easy-tempered for once in
his life—persisted in his indifference. The seven months
named by the prophetess had gone by, and the dagger
with which she had threatened him had not touched him.
He was in good health, had the approbation of parliament,
saw the nation prosper under his government,
and possessed the wife he had so passionately desired.
Everything appeared to succeed with him, which disconcerted
the fanatics. To encourage them Elizabeth
said: 'Do not be deceived. Henry is no longer really
king, and his subjects are already released from every
obligation towards him. But he is like King John, who,
though rejected by God, seemed still to be a king in
the eyes of the world.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_28" id="Ref_28" href="#Foot_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The conspirators intrigued more than ever: not content
with Catherine's alliance, they opened a communication
with Margaret Plantagenet, Countess of Salisbury,
niece of Edward IV., and with her children the representatives
of the party of the White Rose. Hitherto this
lady had refrained from politics; but her son Reginald
Pole, having united with the pope and quarrelled with
Henry VIII., they prevailed upon her to carry over to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
the Princess Mary, whose household she directed, the
forces of the party of which she was the head.</p>

<p class="side">=THE CONSPIRATORS ARRESTED.=</p>

<p>The conspirators believed themselves sure of victory;
but at the very moment when they imagined themselves
on the point of restoring the papacy in England, their
whole scheme suddenly fell to the ground. The country
was in danger: the state must interfere. Cranmer and
Cromwell were the first to discover the approaching
storm. Canterbury, the primate's archiepiscopal city, was
the centre of the criminal practices of the Kentish girl.
One day the prioress of the Holy Sepulchre received the
following note from Cranmer: 'Come to my palace next
Friday; bring your nun with you. Do not fail.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_29" id="Ref_29" href="#Foot_29">[29]</a></span>
The
two women duly came; Elizabeth's head was so turned
that she saw in everything that happened the opportunity
of a new triumph. This time she was deceived.
The prelate questioned her; she obstinately maintained
the truth of her revelations, but did not convince the
archbishop, who had her taken to Cromwell, by whom
she was sent to the Tower with five other nuns of her
party. At first Elizabeth proudly stuck to her character
of prophetess; but imprisonment, the searching
questions of the judges, and the grief she felt on seeing
her falsehoods discovered, made her give way at last.
The unhappy creature, a blind tool of the priests, was not
entirely wanting in proper feeling. She began to understand
her offence and to repent of it: she confessed everything.
'I never had a vision in all my life,' she declared;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_30" id="Ref_30" href="#Foot_30">[30]</a></span>
'whatever I said was of my own imagination;
I invented it to please the people about me and to attract
the homage of the world.' The disorder, which had
weakened her head, had much to do with her aberrations.
Master, Bocking, Goold, Deering, and others
guiltier than her, appeared before the Star Chamber.
Elizabeth's confession rendered their denials impossible,
and they acknowledged having attempted to get up an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
insurrection with a view of re-establishing the papacy.
They were condemned to make a public disavowal of
their impostures, and the following Sunday at St. Paul's
was appointed for that purpose. The bishop of Bangor
preached; the nun and her accomplices, who were
exposed on a platform in front of him, confessed their
crimes before the people, and were then led back to
the Tower.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_31" id="Ref_31" href="#Foot_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Personages far more illustrious than these were involved.
Besides an epileptic girl and a few monks, the
names of Fisher and of More were in the indictment.
Cromwell urged both the bishop and the statesman to
petition the king for pardon, assuring them they would
obtain it. 'Good Master Cromwell,' exclaimed Sir
Thomas More, who was much excited and ashamed of
his credulity, 'my poor heart is pierced at the idea that
his Majesty should think me guilty. I confess that I did
believe the nun to be inspired; but I put away far from
me every thought of treason. For the future, neither
monk nor nun shall have power to make me faithless to
my God and my king.' Cranmer, Cromwell, and the
chancellor prevailed on Henry VIII. to strike More's
name out of the bill. The illustrious scholar escaped the
capital punishment with which he was threatened. His
daughter, Margaret Roper, came in a transport of joy
to tell him the news: 'In faith, Meg,' said More with a
smile, '<i>quod differtur non aufertur</i>, what is put off is not
put away.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_32" id="Ref_32" href="#Foot_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The case of the bishop of Rochester was more serious:
he had been in close communication with all those
knaves, and the honest but proud and superstitious
churchman would not acknowledge any fault. Cromwell,
who desired to save the old man, conjured him to
give up all idea of defending himself; but Fisher obstinately
wrote to the House of Lords that he had seen no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
deception in the nun. The name of the king's old tutor
was left, therefore, in the bill of attainder.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_33" id="Ref_33" href="#Foot_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE CRIMINALS CONVICTED.=</p>

<p>The bill was introduced into the House of Lords on
the 21st February, and received the royal assent on the
21st March. The prisoners were brought together in
the Star Chamber to hear their sentence. Their friends
had still some hope; but the Bull which the pope had
issued against Henry VIII. on the 23rd of March, endangering
the order of succession, made indulgence
difficult. The king and his ministers felt it their duty
to anticipate, by a severe example, the rebellion which
the partisans of the pontiff were fomenting in the kingdom.
Sentence of death was pronounced upon all the
criminals.</p>

<p>During this time the unfortunate Elizabeth saw all
the evils she had caused rise up before her eyes: she
was grieved and agitated, she was angry with herself
and trembled at the idea of the temporal and eternal
penalties she had deserved. Death was about to end
this drama of fanaticism. On the 20th April the false
prophetess was carried to Tyburn with her accomplices,
in the midst of a great crowd of people. On reaching
the scaffold, she said: 'I am the cause not only of my
own death, which I have richly deserved, but of the death
of all those who are going to suffer with me. Alas! I
was a poor wretch without learning,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_34" id="Ref_34" href="#Foot_34">[34]</a></span>
but the praises of
the priests about me turned my brain, and I thought I
might say anything that came into my head. Now I
cry to God and implore the king's pardon.' These were
her last words. She fell—she and her accomplices—under
the stroke of the law.</p>

<p>These were the means to which fervent disciples of
Rome had recourse to combat the Reformation in England.
Such weapons recoil against those who employ
them. The blindest partisans of the Church of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
popes continued to look upon this woman as a prophetess,
and her name was in great favor during the
reign of Mary. But the most enlightened Roman catholics
are now careful not to defend the imposture.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_35" id="Ref_35" href="#Foot_35">[35]</a></span>
The fanatical episode was not without its use: it made
the people understand what these pretended visions
and false miracles were, through which the religious
orders had acquired so much influence; and so far contributed
to the suppression of the monasteries within
whose walls such a miserable deception had been concocted.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER II.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">HENRY VIII. SEPARATES ENGLAND FROM THE PAPACY.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Christmas 1533 to June 1534.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> maid of Kent having been executed, her partisans
rallied round another woman, who represented
the Romish system in its highest features, as Elizabeth
Barton had represented it in its more vulgar phase.
After the nun came the queen.</p>

<p class="side">=QUEEN CATHERINE'S FIRMNESS.=</p>

<p>Catherine had always claimed the honors due to the
Queen of England, and her attendants yielded them to
her. 'We made oath to her as queen,' they said, 'and
the king cannot discharge our consciences.' Whenever
Lord Mountjoy, royal commissioner to the daughter of
Ferdinand and Isabella, called her '<i>princess</i>,' she raised
her head haughtily and said to him: 'You shall answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
for this before God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_36" id="Ref_36" href="#Foot_36">[36]</a></span>
'Ah!' exclaimed Mountjoy, fretted
by the vexations of his office, 'I would a thousand times
rather serve the king in the most dangerous cause!'
Mary having also received an injunction to drop her
title of princess, made answer: 'I shall believe no such
order, unless I see his Majesty's signature.' The most
notable partisans of Roman catholicism, and even the
ambassador of Charles V., paid the queen frequent
visits. Henry became uneasy, and shortly before Christmas
1533 he took measures to remove her from her
friends. Catherine opposed everything. Suffolk wrote
to the king: 'I have never seen such an obstinate
woman.' But there was a man quite as obstinate, and
that was Henry.</p>

<p>His most cherished desires had not been satisfied: he
had no son. Should he chance to die, he would leave
two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth; the former supported
by the partisans of the old times, the latter by
those of the new. Civil war would probably decide to
whom the crown should belong. It was necessary to
prevent such a misfortune. The Lords and Commons,
therefore, petitioned the king, no doubt at his instigation,
that his marriage with Lady Catherine should be
declared null, and her child illegitimate; that his marriage
with Queen Anne should be recognized as valid,
and the children issuing from it alone entitled to succeed.
All classes of people immediately took the
statutory oath; even the monks bowed their heads.
They said: 'Bound to render to our king Henry VIII.
and to him alone after Jesus Christ,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_37" id="Ref_37" href="#Foot_37">[37]</a></span>
fidelity and worship,
we promise inviolable obedience to our said lord as
well as to our most serene Queen Anne, his wife, and to
their children; and we profess perpetual respect for
the holy and chaste marriage which they have legitimately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
contracted.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_38" id="Ref_38" href="#Foot_38">[38]</a></span>
This forced testimony, borne to
Anne by the monastic orders, is one of the numerous
monuments of the despotism of Henry VIII. and of the
moral weakness of the monks.</p>

<p>But in this oath of allegiance the king had meditated
a more important object—to banish the papacy from
England. The monks bound themselves not only to
recognize the prescribed order of succession, but further
to substitute the primacy of the king for that of the
pope. 'We affirm,' they said, 'that King Henry is the
head of the Anglican Church, that the Roman bishop,
falsely styled pope and sovereign pontiff, has no more
authority than any other bishop; and we promise to
preach Christ simply and openly according to the rule
of Scripture and of the orthodox and catholic doctors.'
A sign, a word from the State was sufficient to make
the papal army pass from the camp of Rome to the
camp of the king.</p>

<p>The 'famous question,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_39" id="Ref_39" href="#Foot_39">[39]</a></span>
that of the Romish jurisdiction,
was also put before the two universities. On the
2nd May Cambridge declared, that 'all its doctors having
carefully examined the Holy Scriptures, had not discovered
the primacy of the pope in them.' The clergy of
the province of York, led by the archbishop Edward Lee,
a churchman full of talent, activity, and vanity, stoutly
resisted at first; but eventually the prelate wrote to the
king on the 2nd June that 'according to the unanimous
opinion of his clergy, the pope in conformity with the
Holy Scriptures had no more authority in England than
any other foreign ecclesiastic.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_40" id="Ref_40" href="#Foot_40">[40]</a></span>
Henry, not content
with the proclamations of his council and the declarations
of parliament, required for his separation from
Rome the suffrage of the Church; and the Church, probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
more from weakness than conviction, gave it. However,
without reckoning the members of the clergy who,
like the primate, wanted no pope, there were many
bishops who, at heart, were not sorry to be liberated
from the perpetual encroachments of the Roman court.</p>

<p class="side">=RESISTANCE AGAINST INVASION.=</p>

<p>A rumor from the continent suddenly disquieted the
king among all his easy triumphs; a more formidable
enemy than those monks and bishops was rising against
him. It was reported that the emperor was not only
recruiting soldiers in Flanders, but was forwarding considerable
numbers from Bohemia, Germany, Italy, and
Spain for the invasion of England.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_41" id="Ref_41" href="#Foot_41">[41]</a></span>
Francis I. could
not permit this kingdom, so close to his own, to be occupied
by the armies of Charles V. his constant enemy;
he determined therefore to have an interview with
Henry, and to that intent sent over the Seigneur De la
Guiche, his chamberlain and counsellor.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_42" id="Ref_42" href="#Foot_42">[42]</a></span>
Henry replied
that it would be difficult to leave England just at
a time when pope and emperor spoke of invading him;
the more so as he must leave his 'most dearly beloved
queen' (Anne Boleyn) and his young daughter, the
Princess Elizabeth; as well as another daughter and
her mother, the aunt of Charles V., whose partisans
were conspiring against him. 'Ask my good brother
the king,' said Henry to De la Guiche, 'to collect a fleet
of ships, galleys, and barks to prevent the emperor's
landing. And in case that prince should invade either
France or England, let us agree that the one who is not
called upon to defend his own kingdom shall march into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
Charles's territories.' However, Henry consented to
go as far as Calais.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_43" id="Ref_43" href="#Foot_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>There was another invasion which, in Henry's eyes, was
much more to be dreaded. That king—a greater king
perhaps than is ordinarily supposed—maintained that
no prince, whether his name was Charles or Clement,
had any business to meddle with his kingdom. The
act of the 23rd March, by which the pope had condemned
him, had terminated his long endurance: Clement VII.
had declared war against him and Henry VIII. accepted
it. A man, though he be ordinarily the slave of his
passions, has sometimes impulses which belong to great
characters. Henry determined to finish with the pope
as the pope had finished with him. He will declare
himself master in his own island; dauntlessly he will
brave Rome and the imperial power ready to assail
him. Erelong the fire which consumed him appeared
to kindle his subjects. The political party, at the head
of which were Suffolk and Gardiner, was ready to give
up the papacy, even while maintaining the dogmas of
catholicism. The evangelical party desired to go farther,
and drive the catholic doctrines out of England. These
two hostile sections united their forces against the common
enemy.</p>

<p>At the head of the evangelicals, who were eventually
to prevail under the son of Henry VIII., were two men
of great intelligence, destined to be powerful instruments
in the enfranchisement of England. Cranmer,
the ecclesiastical leader of the party, gave way too easily
to the royal pressure; but being a moderate theologian,
a conscientious Christian, a skilful administrator, and
indefatigable worker, he carefully studied the Scriptures,
the Fathers, and even the Schoolmen; he took
note of their sayings, and strengthened by their opinions,
continued the work of the Reformation with calmness
and perseverance. Beside him stood Cromwell, the lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
leader of protestant feeling. Gifted in certain respects
with a generous character, he loved to benefit those
who had helped him in adversity; but too attentive to
his own interests, he profited by the Reformation to increase
his riches and honors. Inferior to Cranmer in
moral qualities, he had a surer and a wider glance than
the primate; he saw clearly the end for which he must
strive and the means necessary to be employed, and
combined much activity with his talents. These leaders
were strongly supported. A certain number of ministers
and lay members of the Church desired an evangelical
reform in England. Latimer, a popular orator,
was the tribune commissioned to scatter through the nation
the principles whose triumph Cranmer and Cromwell
sought. He preached throughout the whole extent of
the province of Canterbury; but if his bold language
enlightened the well-disposed, it irritated the priests
and monks. His great reputation led to his being
invited to preach before the king and queen. Cranmer,
fearing his incisive language and sarcastic tone, begged
him to say nothing in the pulpit that would indicate any
soreness about his late disgrace. 'In your sermon let
not any sparkle or suspicion of grudge appear to remain
in you.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_44" id="Ref_44" href="#Foot_44">[44]</a></span>
If you attack with the Word of God any sin
or superstition, do it without passion.' Latimer preached,
and Anne Boleyn was so charmed by his evangelical
simplicity, Christian eloquence, and apostolic zeal, that
she made him her chaplain. Latimer takes his place by
the side of Cranmer among the reformers of the English
Church.</p>

<p class="side">=THE PAPAL AUTHORITY ABOLISHED.=</p>

<p>The evangelical and the political parties being thus
agreed to support the prince, Henry determined to
strike the decisive blow. On the 9th June, 1534, about
three months after he had been condemned at Rome,
he signed at Westminster the proclamation 'for the
abolishing of the usurped power of the pope.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_45" id="Ref_45" href="#Foot_45">[45]</a></span>
The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
king declared: 'That having been acknowledged next
after God, supreme head of the Church of England, he
abolished the authority of the bishop of Rome throughout
his realm, and commanded all bishops to preach
and have preached, every Sunday and holy day, the
sweet and sincere Word of the Lord; to teach that the
jurisdiction of the Church belongs to him alone, and to
blot out of all canons, liturgies, and other works the
name of the bishop of Rome and his pompous titles, so
that his name and memory be never more remembered
in the kingdom of England, except to his contumely
and reproach.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_46" id="Ref_46" href="#Foot_46">[46]</a></span>
By so doing you will advance the
honor of God Almighty, manifest the imperial majesty of
your sovereign lord, and procure for the people unity,
tranquillity, and prosperity.'</p>

<p class="side">=THE CHURCH, A STATE-DEPARTMENT.=</p>

<p>Would these orders be executed? If there remained
in any university, convent, parish, or even in any
wretched presbytery, a breviary in which the name of
the <i>pope</i> was written; if on the altar of any poor country
church a missal was found with these four letters
unerased—it was a crime. If every weed be not plucked
up, thought the king's counsellors, the garden will soon be
entirely overrun. The obstinacy of the clergy, their
stratagems, their pious frauds were a mystery to nobody.
Henry was persuaded, and his counsellors still more so,
that the bishops would make no opposition; they resolved
therefore to direct the sheriffs to see that the
king's orders were strictly carried out. 'We command
you,' said that prince, 'under pain of our high indignation,
to put aside all human respect, to place God's
glory solely before you, and, at the risk of exposing
yourselves to the greatest perils, to make and order diligent
search to be made.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_47" id="Ref_47" href="#Foot_47">[47]</a></span>
Inform yourselves whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
in every part of your county the bishop executes our
commands without veil or dissimulation. And in case
you should observe that he neglects some portion, or
carries out our orders coldly, or presents this measure
in a bad light, we command you strictly to inform us
and our council with all haste.</p>

<p>'If you hesitate or falter in the commission we give
you, rest assured that being a prince who loves justice,
we will punish you with such severity that all our subjects
will take care for the future not to disobey our
commands.'</p>

<p>Everybody could see that Henry was in earnest,
and immediately after this energetic proclamation, those
who were backward hastened to make their submission.
The dean and chapter of St. Paul's made their protest
against the pope on the 20th June. On the 27th the
University of Oxford, in an act where they described the
king as 'that most wise Solomon,' declared unanimously
that it was contrary to the Word of God to acknowledge
any superiority whatsoever in the bishop of Rome. A
great number of churches and monasteries set their
seals to similar declarations.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_48" id="Ref_48" href="#Foot_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the first pastoral of the prince who claimed
now to govern the Church. He seemed desirous of
making it a mere department of the State. Henry
allowed the bishops to remain, but he employed the
functionaries of police and justice to overlook their episcopate;
and that office was imposed upon them in such
terms that they must necessarily look sharp after the
transgressors. First and foremost the king wanted his
own way in his family, in the State, and in the Church.
The latter was to him as a ship which he had just captured:
the captain was driven out, but for fear lest he
should return, he threw overboard all who he thought
might betray him. With haughty head and naked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
sword Henry VIII. entered the new realm which he had
conquered. He was far from resembling Him whom
the prophets had announced: <i>Behold thy king cometh
unto thee, meek and lowly</i>.</p>

<p class="side">=FORM THE CHURCH SHOULD TAKE.=</p>

<p>The power in the Church having been taken from the
pope, to whom should it have been committed?</p>

<p>Scripture calls the Christian people a holy nation,
a royal priesthood;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_49" id="Ref_49" href="#Foot_49">[49]</a></span>
words which show that, after God,
the authority belongs to them. And, in fact, the first
act of the Church, the election of an apostle in the place
of Judas, was performed by the brethren assembled in
one place.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_50" id="Ref_50" href="#Foot_50">[50]</a></span>
When it became necessary to appoint deacons,
the twelve apostles once more summoned 'the
multitude of the disciples.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_51" id="Ref_51" href="#Foot_51">[51]</a></span>
And later still, the evangelists,
the delegates of the flocks, were selected by the
voice of the churches.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_52" id="Ref_52" href="#Foot_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a principle of reason, that authority, where a corporate
body is concerned, resides in the totality of its
members. This principle of reason is also that of the
Word of God.</p>

<p>When the Church became more numerous it was
called upon to delegate (at least partially) a power that it
could no longer exercise wholly of itself. In the apostolic
age the Christians, called to form this delegation,
adopted the forms with which they were familiar. After
the pattern of the council of elders, which existed in the
Jewish synagogues, and of the assembly of decurions,
which exercised municipal functions in the cities of the
pagans,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_53" id="Ref_53" href="#Foot_53">[53]</a></span>
the Christian Church had in every town a
council, composed of men of irreproachable life, vigilant,
prudent, apt to teach,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_54" id="Ref_54" href="#Foot_54">[54]</a></span>
but distinct from those who
were called doctors, evangelists, or ministers of the
Word.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_55" id="Ref_55" href="#Foot_55">[55]</a></span>
Still the Christians never entertained the idea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
of giving themselves a universal chief, after the image of
the emperor. Jesus Christ and his Word were amply
sufficient. It was not until many centuries later that
this anti-Christian institution appeared in history.</p>

<p>The authority, which in England had been taken
away from the pope, should return in accordance with
scriptural principles to the members of the Church;
and if, following the example of the primitive Christians,
they had adopted the forms existing in their own country
in the sixteenth century, they would have placed as
directors of the Church—Christ remaining their sole
king—one or two houses or assemblies, authorized to
provide for the ecclesiastical administration, the maintenance
of a pure faith, and the spiritual prosperity of
that vast body. These assemblies would have been
composed, as in the primitive times, of a majority of
Christian laymen, with the addition of ministers; and
both would have been elected by believers whose faith
was in conformity with that of the Church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_56" id="Ref_56" href="#Foot_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>But was there at that time in England a sufficient
number of enlightened Christians to become members
of these assemblies, and even to hold the elections
which were to appoint them? It is doubtful. They
were not to be found even in Germany. 'I have nobody
to put in them,' said Luther; 'but if the thing
becomes feasible, I shall not be wanting in my duty.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_57" id="Ref_57" href="#Foot_57">[57]</a></span>

This form of government not being possible in England
then, according to the Reformer's expression, two
other forms offered themselves. If the first were
adopted, the authority would be remitted to the clergy;
but that would have been to perpetuate the doctrines
and rites of popery and to lead back infallibly to the
domination of Rome. The most dangerous government
for the Church is the government of priests: they commonly
rob it of liberty, spontaneousness, evangelical
faith, and life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span></p>

<p>There remained no alternative then but to confide
the supreme authority in the Church to the State; and
this is what was generally done in the sixteenth century.
But men of the greatest experience in these matters
have agreed that the government of the religious society
by the civil power can only be a temporary expedient,
and have universally proclaimed the great principle,
'that the essence of all society is to be governed by
itself.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_58" id="Ref_58" href="#Foot_58">[58]</a></span>
To deny this axiom would be utterly contrary
not only to liberty, but, further still, contrary to justice.</p>

<p>We must not forget when we speak of the relations
between Church and State, that there are three different
systems:—the government of the Church by the State;
the union of the Church, governing itself, with the
State; and their complete separation. There is no
reason for pronouncing here upon the relative value of
the two last systems.</p>

 <span style="font-size:80%">BEGINNING OF DANGER FOR THE QUEEN AND FOR TYNDALE.<br />
 (<span class="smc">1534 to August 1535.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">Two</span> persons were at this time specially dreaded by the
Roman party: one was at the summit of the grandeurs
of the world, the other at the summit of the grandeurs
of faith—the queen and Tyndale. The hour of trial
was approaching for both of them.</p>

<p>There existed another reformation than that of which
the sheriffs were to be the agents; there were other
reformers than Henry VIII. One man, desirous of reviving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
the Church of Christ in England, had made the
translation of the Holy Scriptures the work of his life.
Tyndale had been forced to leave his country; but he
had left it only to prepare a seed which, borne on the
wings of the wind, was to change the wildernesses of
Great Britain into a fruitful garden.</p>

<p class="side">=TYNDALE AT ANTWERP.=</p>

<p>The retired teacher from the vale of the Severn had
settled in 1534 as near as possible to England—at Antwerp,
whence ships departed frequently for British
harbors. The English merchants, of whom there were
many in that city, welcomed him with fraternal cordiality.
Among them was a friend of the Gospel, Mr.
Thomas Poyntz, whose brother filled an office in the
king's household. This warm-hearted Christian had received
Tyndale into his house, and the latter was
unremittingly occupied in translating the Old Testament,
when an English ship brought the news of the
martyrdom of Fryth, his faithful colleague. Tyndale
shed many tears, and could not make up his mind to
continue his work alone. But the reflection that Fryth
had glorified Jesus Christ in his prison, aroused him:
he felt it his duty to glorify God in his exile. The loss
of his friend made his Saviour still more precious to
him, and in Jesus he found comfort for his mind. 'I
have lost my brother,' he said, 'but in Christ, all Christians
and even all the angels are father and mother,
sister and brother, and God himself takes care of me.
O Christ, my Redeemer and my shield! thy blood, thy
death, all that Thou art and all that Thou hast done—Thou
thyself art mine!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_59" id="Ref_59" href="#Foot_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=TYNDALE'S CHARITY AND ZEAL.=</p>

<p>Tyndale, strengthened by faith, redoubled his zeal in
his Master's service. That indefatigable man was not
content to study the Scriptures with eagerness: he
desired to combine with learning the charity that
worketh. The English merchants of Antwerp, having
given him a considerable sum of money, he consecrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
it to the poor; but he was not content with mere
giving. Besides Sunday he reserved two days in the
week, which he called his 'days of recreation.' On
Monday he visited the most out of the way streets of
Antwerp, hunting in garrets for the poor English refugees
who had been driven from their country on
account of the Gospel; he taught them to bear Christ's
burden, and carefully tended their sick. On Saturday,
he went out of the city, visiting the villages and solitary
houses, and 'seeking out every hole and corner.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_60" id="Ref_60" href="#Foot_60">[60]</a></span>
Should he happen to meet some hard-working father
burdened with children, or some aged or infirm man, he
hastened to share his substance with the poor creatures.
'We ought to be for our neighbor,' he said, 'what
Christ has been for us.' This is what Tyndale called
his 'pastime.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_61" id="Ref_61" href="#Foot_61">[61]</a></span>
On Sunday morning he went to a
merchant's house where a large room had been prepared
for evangelical worship, and read and explained the
Scriptures with so much sweetness and unction and in
such a practical spirit that the congregation (it was said)
fancied they were listening to John the Evangelist.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_62" id="Ref_62" href="#Foot_62">[62]</a></span>
During the remainder of the week the laborious doctor
gave himself entirely to his translation. He was not
one of those who remain idle in the hope that grace
may abound. 'If we are justified by faith,' he said, 'it
is in order that we may do Christian works.'</p>

<p>There came good news from London to console him
for the death of Fryth. In every direction people were
asking for the New Testament; several Flemish printers
began to reprint it, saying: 'If Tyndale should print
2000 copies, and we as many, they would be few enough
for all England.' Four new editions of the sacred book
issued from the Antwerp presses in 1534.</p>

<p>There was at that time living in the city a man little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
fitted to be Tyndale's associate. George Joye, a fellow
of Cambridge, was one of those active but superficial
persons, with little learning and less judgment, who are
never afraid to launch out into works beyond their
powers. Joye, who had left England in 1527, noticing
the consideration which Tyndale's labors brought to
their author, and being also desirous of acquiring glory
for himself, began, though he knew neither Hebrew nor
Greek, to correct Tyndale's New Testament according
to the Vulgate and his own imagination. One day when
Tyndale had refused to adopt one of his extravagant
corrections, Joye was touched to the quick: 'I am not
afraid to cope with him in this matter,' he said, 'for all
his high learning in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_63" id="Ref_63" href="#Foot_63">[63]</a></span>
Tyndale
knew more than these. 'He is master of seven
languages,' said Busche, Reuchlin's disciple: 'Hebrew,
Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, English, French, and so
thoroughly, that whichever he is speaking one might
believe it to be his mother tongue.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_64" id="Ref_64" href="#Foot_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>In the month of August Joye's translation appeared
at Antwerp: he had advertised it as 'clearer and more
faithful.' Tyndale glanced over the leaves of the work
that had been so praised by its author, and was vexed
to find himself so unskilfully 'corrected.' He pointed
out some of Joye's errors, and made this touching and
solemn declaration: 'I protest in the presence of God
and Jesus Christ, and before the whole assembly of
believers, that I have never written anything through
envy, to circulate any error, or to attract followers to
me. I have never had any other desire than to lead my
brethren to the knowledge of Christ. And if in what I
have written or translated there should be anything
opposed to God's word, I beg all men to reject it as I
reject it myself, before Christ and his assembly.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span></p>

<p>It was in November 1534 that Tyndale made this
noble protest.</p>

<p>While Joye was waging this petty war against Tyndale,
every ship that came from London to Antwerp
brought the cheering news that the great war seemed to
be dying out in England, and that the king and those
around him were drawing towards protestantism. A
change had been worked in Anne's mind analogous to
that which had been wrought in her position. She had
been ambitious and worldly, but from the moment she
ascended the throne, her character had expanded; she
had become queen, she wished to be the mother of her
people, especially of those who trod in the paths of Holy
Scripture. In the first transports of his affection,
Henry had desired to share all the honors of sovereignty
with her, and she had taken this high position
more seriously than Henry had intended. When he
saw her whom he had placed by his side imagine that
she had any power, the selfish and jealous monarch knit
his brows: this was the beginning of the storm that
drove Anne Boleyn from the throne to the scaffold.
She ventured to order Cromwell to indemnify the merchants
who had suffered loss for having introduced the
New Testament into England. 'If a day passes,' people
said, 'without her having an opportunity of doing a
service to a friend of the Gospel, she is accustomed to
say with Titus, "I have lost a day."' Harman, a
merchant of Antwerp and a man of courage, who had
helped Tyndale to publish the Gospel in English, had
been kept seven months in prison by Wolsey and
Hacket.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_65" id="Ref_65" href="#Foot_65">[65]</a></span>
Although set at liberty, he was still deprived
of his privileges and compelled to suspend business.
He came over to England, but instead of applying either
to the lord chancellor or to Cromwell for the restoration
of his rights, he went straight to the queen. Anne,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
who was then at Greenwich palace, was touched by his
piety and sufferings, and probably without taking council
of the king, she dictated the following message to
the prime minister, which we think worth quoting at
full.</p>

<p class="center smc">By the Queen.</p>

<div class="small">

<p><i>Anne the Queen.</i>—Trusty and right well-beloved, we greet you
well. And whereas we be credibly informed that the bearer hereof,
Richard Harman, merchant and citizen of Antwerp in Brabant,
was in the time of the late lord cardinal put and expelled from his
freedom and fellowship of and in the English house there, for
nothing else, as he affirmeth like a good Christian man,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_66" id="Ref_66" href="#Foot_66">[66]</a></span>
but only
for that, that he did, both with his goods and policy to his great
hurt and hindrance in this world, help to the setting forth of the
New Testament in English. We therefore desire and instantly
pray you, that with all speed and favor convenient, you will cause
this good and honest merchant, being my Lord's true, faithful,
and loving subject, to be restored to his pristine freedom, liberty,
and fellowship aforesaid. And the sooner at this our request:
and at your good pleasure to hear him in such things as he hath
to make further relation unto you in this behalf.</p>

<p>Given under our signet at my Lord's manor of Greenwich, the
xiv. day of May.</p>

<p>To our trusty and well-beloved Thomas Cromwell, principal
secretary to his Majesty, the king my lord.</p>

</div>

<p class="gap-above2">This intervention of the queen in favor of a persecuted
evangelical was much talked about. Some ascribed her
conduct to the interests of her own cause, others to
humanity: most of the friends of the Reformation
regarded it as a proof that Anne was gained over to
their convictions, and Tyndale manifested his gratitude
to the queen by presenting her with a handsome copy
of his New Testament.</p>

<p class="side">=DISPLEASURE OF THE KING.=</p>

<p>What gave such joy to Tyndale annoyed the king
greatly. Such a private order as this coming from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
queen singularly displeased a monarch whose will it
was that no business should be discussed except in his
council. There was also in this order, at least in Henry's
eyes, a still greater evil. The evangelical reformation,
which Henry had so stoutly combated and which he
detested to the last, was making great progress in England.
On the 4th of July, 1533, Fryth, the friend of
Harman and Tyndale, was burnt at Smithfield, as being
one of its followers; and ten months later, on the 14th
of May, 1534, Harman, the friend of Tyndale and Fryth,
had been declared 'a good Christian' by the queen.
Anne dared profess herself the friend of those whom
the king hated. Did she design to make a revolution—to
oppose the opinions of her lord the king? That
letter did not remain without effect: it was reported
that the friends of the Word of God, taking advantage
of these favorable dispositions, were printing at Antwerp
six separate editions of the New Testament, and
were introducing them into England.</p>

<p class="side">=SNARES LAID FOR TYNDALE.=</p>

<p>It was not only the king who was irritated, the anger
of the Romish party was greater still; but as they dared
not strike the queen, they looked about for another victim.
Neither Bishop Fisher, Sir Thomas More, nor
Henry VIII. appear to have had any part in this new
crime. Gardiner, now bishop of Winchester, gave a
force to the episcopal body of which it had long been
deprived; and several prelates, 'incensed and inflamed
in their minds,' says a document,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_67" id="Ref_67" href="#Foot_67">[67]</a></span>
called to remembrance
that the best means of drying up the waters of a
river is to cut off its springs. It was from Tyndale that
all those writings proceeded—those Gospels which, in
their opinion, were leading England astray. The
moment seemed favorable for getting rid of him: he
was actually in the states of Charles V., that great enemy
of the Reformation. Gardiner and his allies determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
to send into the Low Countries two persons with instructions
to keep an eye upon the reformer, to take him
unawares, and have him put to death. For this purpose
they selected a very clever monk of Stratford
Abbey and a zealous young papist, who had the look of
a gentleman, and who (they hoped) would soon gain
Tyndale's heart by his amiability.</p>

<p>It was about the end of the year 1534, while the reformer
was still living at Antwerp in the house of
Thomas Poyntz, when one day, dining with another
merchant, he observed among the guests a tall young
man of good appearance whom he did not know. 'He
is a fellow-countryman,' said the master of the house,
'Mr. Harry Philips, a person of very agreeable manners.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_68" id="Ref_68" href="#Foot_68">[68]</a></span>
Tyndale drew near the stranger and was
charmed with his conversation. After dinner, just as
they were about to separate, he observed another person
near Philips, whose countenance from being less open
pleaded little in his favor. It was 'Gabriel, his servant,'
he was told. Tyndale invited Philips to come
and see him: the young layman accepted the invitation,
and the candid reformer was so taken with him, that he
could not pass a day without him—inviting him at one
time to dinner, at another to supper. At length Philips
became so necessary to him that he prevailed upon him,
with Poyntz's consent, to come and live in the same
house with him. For some time they had lost sight of
Gabriel, and on Tyndale's asking what had become of
him, he was informed that he had gone to Louvain, the
centre of Roman clericalism in Belgium. When Tyndale
and Philips were once lodged beneath the same
roof, their intimacy increased: Tyndale had no secrets
from his fellow-countryman. The latter spent hours in
the library of the hellenist, who showed him his books
and manuscripts, and conversed with him about his past
and future labors, and the means that he possessed for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
circulating the New Testament throughout England.
The translator of the Bible, all candor and simplicity,
supposing no evil, thinking nothing but good of his
neighbor, unbosomed himself to him like a child.</p>

<p>Philips, less of a gentleman than he appeared, was
the son of a tax-gatherer in Devonshire; and the pretended
domestic, a disguised monk, was that crafty and
vicious churchman, who had been brought from Stratford
and given to the so-called gentleman—apparently
as a servant, but really as his counsellor and master.
Neither Wolsey, More, nor Hacket had succeeded in
getting hold of Tyndale; but Gardiner, a man of
innate malice and indirect measures, familiar with all
holes and corners, all circumstances and persons, knew
how to go to work without noise, to watch his prey
in silence, and fall upon it at the very moment when he
was least expected. Two things were required in
order to catch Tyndale: a bait to attract him, and a
bird of prey to seize him. Philips was the bait, and
the monk Gabriel Dunne the bird of prey. The noble-hearted
Poyntz, a man of greater experience than the
reformer, had been for some time watching with inquisitive
eye the new guest introduced into his house.
It was of no use for Philips to try to be agreeable,
there was something in him which displeased the
worthy merchant.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_69" id="Ref_69" href="#Foot_69">[69]</a></span>
'Master Tyndale,' he said one day
to the reformer, 'when did you make that person's
acquaintance?'—'Oh! he's a very worthy fellow,' replied
the doctor, 'well-educated and a thorough gentleman.'
Poyntz said no more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the monk had returned from Louvain,
where he had gone to consult with some leaders of the
ultramontane party. If he and his companion could
gain Mr. Poyntz, it would be easy to lay hold of Tyndale.
They thought it would be sufficient to show the
merchant that they had money, imagining that every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
man was to be bought. One day Philips said to Poyntz:
'I am a stranger here, and should feel much obliged if
you would show me Antwerp.' They went out together.
Philips thought the moment had come to let
Poyntz know that he was well supplied with gold, and
even had some to give to others. 'I want to make
several purchases,' he said, 'and you would greatly
oblige me by directing me. I want the best goods. I
have plenty of money,' he added.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_70" id="Ref_70" href="#Foot_70">[70]</a></span>
He then took a
step farther, and sounded his man to try whether he
would aid him in his designs. As Poyntz did not seem
to understand him, Philips went no farther.</p>

<p class="side">=IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT CONSULTED.=</p>

<p>As stratagem did not succeed, it was necessary to
resort to force. Philips by Gabriel's advice set out for
Brussels in order to prepare the blow that was to strike
Tyndale. The emperor and his ministers had never
been so irritated against England and the Reformation.
The troops of Charles V. were in motion, and people
expected to hear every moment that war had broken
out between the emperor and the king.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_71" id="Ref_71" href="#Foot_71">[71]</a></span>
On arriving
at Brussels the young Englishman appeared at court
and waited on the government: he declared that he
was a Roman catholic disgusted with the religious reforms
in England and devoted to the cause of Catherine.
He explained to the ministers of Charles V. that they
had in the Low Countries the man who was poisoning
the kingdom; and that if they put Tyndale to death,
they would save the papacy in England. The emperor's
ministers, delighted to see Englishmen making common
cause with them against Henry VIII., conceded to
Gardiner's delegate all that he asked. Philips, sparing
no expense to attain his end,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_72" id="Ref_72" href="#Foot_72">[72]</a></span>
returned to Antwerp,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
accompanied by the imperial prosecutor and other
officers of the emperor.</p>

<p>It was important to arrest Tyndale without having
recourse to the city authorities, and even without their
knowledge. Had not the hanseatic judges the strange
audacity to declare, in Harman's case, that they could
not condemn a man without positive proof? The monk,
who probably had not gone to Brussels, undertook to
reconnoitre the ground. One day, when Poyntz was
sitting at his door,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_73" id="Ref_73" href="#Foot_73">[73]</a></span>
Gabriel went up to him and said:
'Is Master Tyndale at home? My master desires to
call upon him.' They entered into conversation.
Everything seemed to favor the monk's designs: he
learnt that in three or four days Poyntz would be going
to Bar-le-Duc, where he would remain about six weeks.
It was just what Gabriel wanted, for he dreaded the
piercing eye of the English merchant.</p>

<p class="side">=TREACHERY OF PHILIPS.=</p>

<p>Shortly after this, Philips arrived in Antwerp with
the prosecutor and his officers. The former went
immediately to Poyntz's house, where he found only
the wife at home. 'Does Master Tyndale dine at home
to-day?' he said. 'I have a great desire to dine with
him. Have you anything good to give us?' 'What we
can get in the market,' she replied laconically.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_74" id="Ref_74" href="#Foot_74">[74]</a></span>
'Good,
good,' said the perfidious papist as he turned away.</p>

<p>The new Judas hurried to meet the officers, and
agreed with them upon the course to be adopted.
When the dinner-hour drew near, he said: 'Come along,
I will deliver him to you.' The imperial prosecutor
and his followers, with Philips and the monk, proceeded
towards Poyntz's house, carefully noting everything and
taking the necessary measures not to attract observation.
The entrance to the house was by a long narrow passage.
Philips placed some of the agents a little way down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
street; others, near the entrance of the alley. 'I shall
come out with Tyndale,' he told the agents; 'and the
man I point out with my finger, is the one you will
seize.' With these words Philips entered the house; it
was about noon.</p>

<p>The creature was exceedingly fond of money; he had
received a great deal from the priests in England for the
payment of his mission; but he thought it would be
only right to plunder his victim, before giving him up to
death. Finding Tyndale at home, he said to him, after
a few compliments: 'I must tell you my misfortune.
This morning I lost my purse between here and Mechlin,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_75" id="Ref_75" href="#Foot_75">[75]</a></span>
and I am penniless. Could you lend me some money?'
Tyndale, simple and inexperienced in the tricks of the
world,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_76" id="Ref_76" href="#Foot_76">[76]</a></span>
went to fetch the required sum, which was
equivalent to thirty pounds sterling. The delighted
Philips put the gold carefully in his pocket, and then
thought only of betraying his kind-hearted friend. 'Well,
Master Tyndale,' he said, 'we are going to dine together.'
'No,' replied the doctor, 'I am going to dine out to-day;
come along with me, I will answer for it that you will be
welcome.' Philips joyfully consented; promptitude of
execution was one element of success in his business.
The two friends prepared to start. The alley by which
they had to go out was (as we have said) so narrow that
two persons could not walk abreast. Tyndale, wishing
to do the honors to Philips, desired him to go first. 'I
will never consent,' replied the latter, pretending to be
very polite.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_77" id="Ref_77" href="#Foot_77">[77]</a></span>
'I know the respect due to you—it is for
you to lead the way.' Then taking the doctor respectfully
by the hand, he led him into the passage. Tyndale,
who was of middle height, went first, while Philips, who
was very tall, came behind him. He had placed two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
agents at the entrance, who were sitting at each side of
the alley. Hearing footsteps they looked up and saw
the innocent Tyndale approaching them without suspicion,
and over his shoulders the head of Philips. He
was a lamb led to slaughter by the man who was about
to sell him. The officers of justice, frequently so hardhearted,
experienced a feeling of compassion at the
sight.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_78" id="Ref_78" href="#Foot_78">[78]</a></span>
But the traitor, raising himself behind the
reformer, who was about to enter the street, placed his
forefinger over Tyndale's head, according to the signal
which had been agreed upon, and gave the men a significant
look, as if to say to them, 'This is he!' The
men at once laid hands upon Tyndale who, in his holy
simplicity, did not at first understand what they intended
doing. He soon found it out; for they ordered
him to move on, the officers following him, and he was
thus taken before the imperial prosecutor. The latter
who was at dinner invited Tyndale to sit down with
him. Then ordering his servants to watch him carefully,
the magistrate set off for Poyntz's house. He seized
the papers, books, and all that had belonged to the reformer;
and returning home, placed him with the booty
in a carriage, and departed. The night came on, and
after a drive of about three hours they arrived in front
of the strong castle of Vilvorde, built in 1375 by duke
Wenceslaus, situated two or three leagues from Brussels
on the banks of the Senne, surrounded on all sides by
water and flanked by seven towers. The drawbridge
was lowered, and Tyndale was delivered into the hands
of the governor, who put him into a safe place. The reformer
of England was not to leave Vilvorde, as Luther
left the Wartburg. This occurred, as it would appear,
in August 1535.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_79" id="Ref_79" href="#Foot_79">[79]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=TYNDALE IMPRISONED.=</p>

<p>The object of his mission once attained, Philips, fearing
the indignation of the English merchants, escaped
to Louvain. Sitting in taverns or at the tables of monks,
professors, and prelates—sometimes even at the court
of Brussels, he would boast of his exploit, and desiring
to win the favor of the imperialists would call Henry VIII.
a tyrant and a robber of the State.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_80" id="Ref_80" href="#Foot_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The English merchants of Antwerp, being reasonably
offended, immediately called upon the governor of the
English factory to take measures in favor of their countryman;
but the governor refused. Tyndale, deprived
of all hope, sought consolation in God. 'Oh! what a
happy thing it is to suffer for righteousness' sake,' he
said.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_81" id="Ref_81" href="#Foot_81">[81]</a></span>
'If I am afflicted on earth with Christ, I have
joy in the hope that I shall be glorified with Him in
heaven. Trials are a most wholesome medicine, and I
will endure them with patience. My enemies destine
me for the stake, but I am as innocent as a new-born
child of the crimes of which they accuse me. My God
will not forsake me. O Christ, thy blood saves me, as
if it had been mine own that was shed upon the cross.
God, as great as He is, is mine with all that He hath.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_82" id="Ref_82" href="#Foot_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Tyndale in his prison at Vilvorde was happier than
Philips at court. If we carefully study the history of
the reformers, we recognize at once that they were not
simply masters of a pure doctrine, but also men of lofty
souls, Christians of great morality and exalted spirituality.
We cannot say as much of their adversaries;
what a contrast here between the traitor and his victim!
The calumnies and insults of the enemies of protestantism
will deceive nobody. If it is sufficient to read the
Bible with a sincere heart in order to believe it; it is
sufficient also to know the lives of the reformers in
order to honor them.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE KING-PONTIFF AGAINST THE ROMAN-CATHOLICS AND THE PAPACY.<br />
 (<span class="smc">1534 and 1535.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="side">=INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CLERGY.=</p>

<p><span class="smc">While</span> the Roman papacy was triumphing in the Low
Countries, a lay papacy was being established in England.
Henry VIII. gave his orders like a sovereign
bishop, <i>summus episcopus</i>, and the majority of the
priests obeyed him. They believed that such an extraordinary
state of things would be but of short duration,
and thought that it was not worth the trouble of dying
in battle against what would perish of itself. They
muttered with their lips what the king ordered them,
and waited for the coming deliverance.</p>

<p>Every preacher was bound to preach once at least
against the usurpations of the papacy; to explain on
that occasion the engagements made by the pope with
the king of England, the duplicity shown by Clement,
and the obligation by which the monarch was bound to
thwart so much falsehood and trickery. The ministers
of the Church were ordered to proclaim the Word of
Christ purely, but to say nothing about the adoration of
saints, the marriage of priests, justification by works and
other doctrines rejected by the reformers, which the
king intended to preserve. The secular clergy generally
obeyed.</p>

<p>There were however numerous exceptions, particularly
in the north of England, and the execution of
Henry's orders gave rise to scenes more or less riotous.
Generally speaking, the partisans of Rome did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
merit a very lively interest; but we must give due credit
to those who ventured to resist a formidable power in
obedience to conscientious principles. There were here
and there a few signs of opposition. On the 24th of
August Father Ricot, when preaching at Sion Monastery,
called the king, according to his orders, 'the head
of the Church;' but added immediately after, that he
who had given the order was alone responsible before
God, and that he 'ought to take steps for the discharge
of his conscience.' The other monks went farther still:
as soon as they heard Henry's new title proclaimed,
there was a movement among them. Father Lache,
who far from resembling his name was inflexible even to
impudence, got up; eight other monks rose with him
and left the chapel 'contrary to the rule of their religion'
and to the great scandal of all the audience.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_83" id="Ref_83" href="#Foot_83">[83]</a></span>
These nine friars, boldly quitting the church one after
another, were the living protest of the monks of England.
That their desire was not to acknowledge Jesus
Christ alone as head, is intelligible: they wanted to
maintain the dominion of the pope in the Church, and
in the State also. The king pope would have none of
these freaks of independence. Bedell, who had received
Cromwell's order to inspect this convent, proposed to
send the nine monks to prison, 'to the terrible example
of their adherents.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_84" id="Ref_84" href="#Foot_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The priests, finding that they must act with prudence,
avoided a repetition of such outbreaks and began secretly
to school their penitents in the confessional, bidding
them employ mental reservations, in order to
conciliate everything. They set the example themselves:
'I have abjured the pope <i>in the outward man</i>, but not
<i>in the inward man</i>,' said one of them to some of his
parishioners.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_85" id="Ref_85" href="#Foot_85">[85]</a></span>
The confessor at Sion Monastery had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
proclaimed the king's new title and even preached upon
it; yet when one of his penitents showed much uneasiness
because he had heard Latimer say that the
pope himself could not pardon sin: 'Do not be afraid,'
said the confessor; 'the pope is assuredly the head of
the Church. True, king and parliament have turned
him out of office here in England; but that will not
last long. The world will change again, you will see,
and that too before long.'—'But we have made oath to
the king as head of the Church,' said some persons to a
priest. 'What matters!' replied he. 'An oath that is
not very strictly made may be broken the same way.'</p>

<p>These mental reservations, however, made many
ecclesiastics and laymen too feel uneasy. They longed
for deliverance: they were on the look out; they turned
their eyes successively towards Ireland which had
risen for the pope, and towards the Low Countries,
whence an imperial fleet was to sail for the subjugation
of England. Men grew excited. In the convents there
were fanatical and visionary monks who, maddened by
the abuses of power under which they suffered, and
fired by persecution, dreamt of nothing but reaction
and vengeance, and expressed their cruel wishes in
daring language. One of them named Maitland, belonging
to the Dominican convent in London, exclaimed
presumptuously, as if he were a prophet: 'Soon I shall
behold a scaffold erected.... On that scaffold will
pass in turn the heads of all those who profess the new
doctrine, and Cranmer will be one of them.... The
king will die a violent and shameful death, and the queen
will be burnt.' Being addicted to the black art, Maitland
pretended to read the future by the help of Satanic
beings. All were not so bold: there were the timid
and fearful. Several monks of Sion House, despairing
of the papacy, were making preparations to escape and
hide themselves in some wilderness or foreign cloister.
'If we succeed,' they said, 'we shall be heard of no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
more, and nobody will know where we are.' This being
told to Bedell, Cromwell's agent, he was content to
say: 'Let them go; the loss will not be great.'
Roman-catholicism was, however, to find more honorable
champions.</p>

<p class="side">=MORE REFUSES TO TAKE THE OATH.=</p>

<p>Two men, a layman and a bishop, celebrated throughout
Christendom, Fisher and Sir Thomas More, were
about to present an opposition to the king which probably
he had not expected. Since More had fathomed
the king's intentions, and resigned the office of chancellor,
he often passed whole nights without sleep, shuddering
at the future which threatened him, and watering
his bed with tears. He feared that he was not firm
enough to brave death. 'O God!' he exclaimed during
his agitated vigils, 'come and help me. I am so weak
I could not endure a fillip.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_86" id="Ref_86" href="#Foot_86">[86]</a></span>
His children wept, his
wife stormed against her husband's enemies, and he
himself employed a singular mode of preparing his
family for the fate that awaited him. One day, when
they were all at table, a serjeant entered the room and
summoned him to appear before the king's commissioners.
'Be of good cheer,' said More; 'the time is
not yet come. I paid this man in order to prepare you
for the calamity that hangs over you.' It was not long
delayed.</p>

<p>Shortly after the condemnation of Elizabeth Barton
the nun, Sir Thomas More, Fisher, and many other influential
men were summoned to the archbishop's palace
to take the oath prescribed in the Act of Succession.
More confessed, received the sacrament, and forbidding
his wife and children to accompany him, as was their
custom, to the boat which was to carry him to Lambeth,
he proceeded in great emotion towards the place where
his future would be decided. His startled family
watched him depart. The ex-chancellor taking his seat
in the boat along with his son-in-law William Roper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
endeavored to restrain his tears and struggled but without
success against his sorrow. At length his face became
more serene, and turning to Roper, he whispered
in his ear, 'I thank our Lord, my son; the field is
won.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_87" id="Ref_87" href="#Foot_87">[87]</a></span>
On his arrival at Lambeth palace, where bishop
Fisher and a great number of ecclesiastics assembled,
More, who was the only layman, was introduced first.
The chancellor read the form to him: it stated in the
preamble that the troubles of England, the oceans of
blood that had been shed in it and many other afflictions,
originated in the usurped power of the popes;
that the king was the head of the Anglican Church, and
that the bishop of Rome possessed no authority out of
his own diocese. 'I cannot subscribe that form,' said
More, 'without exposing my soul to everlasting damnation.
I am ready to give my adhesion to the Act of
Succession which is a political act—but without the
preamble.' 'You are the first man who has refused,'
said the chancellor. 'Think upon it.' A great number
of bishops, doctors, and priests who were successively
introduced, took the required oath. But More
remained firm, and so did bishop Fisher.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_88" id="Ref_88" href="#Foot_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Cranmer, who earnestly desired to save these two
conscientious men, asked Cromwell to accept the oath
they proposed,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_89" id="Ref_89" href="#Foot_89">[89]</a></span>
and the latter consulted the king upon
it. 'They must give way,' exclaimed Henry, 'or I will
make an example of them that shall frighten others.'
As the king was inexorable, they were attainted by act
of parliament for refusing to take the required oath,
and sent to the Tower. This was in December 1534.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_90" id="Ref_90" href="#Foot_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The family of Sir Thomas More was plunged in
affliction. His daughter Margaret having obtained
permission to see him, hurried to the Tower, penetrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
to his cell, and incapable of speaking, fell weeping into
his arms. 'Daughter,' said More, restraining himself
with an effort, 'let us kneel down.' He repeated the
seven penitential Psalms, and then rising up, said:
'Dear Meg, those who have put me here think they
have done me a high displeasure, but God treats me as
He treats his best friends.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_91" id="Ref_91" href="#Foot_91">[91]</a></span>
Margaret, who thought
of nothing but to save her father, exclaimed: 'Take
the oath! death is hanging over your head.' 'Nothing
will happen to me but what pleases God,' replied Sir
Thomas More. His daughter left the Tower overwhelmed
with grief. His wife, who also went to see
him, chancellor Audley, the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk,
Cromwell, and other of the king's counsellors were not
more successful than Margaret. Bishop Fisher met
similar solicitations with a similar refusal.</p>

<p class="side">=RESISTANCE OF THE CARTHUSIANS.=</p>

<p>As the king's government did not wish to hurry on
the trial of these illustrious men, they turned from the
chiefs to the followers. The Carthusians of London
were in great odor of sanctity; they never spoke except
at certain times, ate no meat, and affirmed that
God had visited them in visions and miracles. Their
house was not free from disorders, but many of the
monks took their vocation seriously. When the royal
commissioners visited them to tender the oath of succession,
Prior Haughton, a man of small stature but
agreeable appearance and noble carriage, appeared
before them. The commissioners required him to
acknowledge Henry's second marriage to be lawful;
Haughton at first sought a loophole, and answered
that the king might be divorced and married without
him or his monks having anything to say to it. 'It is
the king's command,' answered the commissioners,
'that you and your brethren acknowledge by oath the
lawfulness of his union. Call the monks together.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_92" id="Ref_92" href="#Foot_92">[92]</a></span>
The Carthusians appeared, and all refused to take the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
oath. The prior and proctor were consequently sent
to the Tower. The bishop of London used all his influence
to make them change their opinions, and succeeded
in persuading them that they might take the
oath, by making several reservations. They therefore
returned to the Charter House and prevailed upon
their brethren to do as they had done.</p>

<p>Immediately all was confusion in the monastery.
Several monks in deep distress could not tell which
course to follow; others, more decided, exclaimed that
they would not yield at any price. 'They are minded
to offer themselves in sacrifice to the great idol of Rome,'
wrote Bedell to Cromwell.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_93" id="Ref_93" href="#Foot_93">[93]</a></span>
At last, when the soldiers
appeared to take the rebels to the Tower, the terrified
monks lost heart, and took the oath to the new marriage
of Henry VIII. 'so far as it was lawful.' The bitter
cup was removed, but not for long.</p>

<p>Whilst England was separating from Rome, Clement VII.
was dying of vexation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_94" id="Ref_94" href="#Foot_94">[94]</a></span>
The hatred felt by the
Romans towards him<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_95" id="Ref_95" href="#Foot_95">[95]</a></span>
was only equalled by the joy
they experienced at the election of his successor. Alexander
Farnese, the choice of the French party, was a
man of the world, desirous of putting down the protestants,
recovering England, reforming the Church, and
above all enriching his own family. When Da Casale,
Henry's envoy, presented his homage: 'There is nothing
in the world,' said Paul III. to him, 'that I have
more at heart than to satisfy your master.' It was too
late.</p>

<p class="side">=HENRY REJECTS THE PAPACY.=</p>

<p>Clement's behavior had produced an evil influence on
the character of the Tudor king. The services rendered
by this prince to the papacy had been overlooked, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
long patience had not been rewarded: he fancied himself
despised and deceived. His pride was irritated,
his temper grew fiercer, his violence for some time
restrained, broke out, and unable to reach the pope, he
revenged himself on the papacy. Until now, he had
scarcely been worse than most of the sovereigns of
Christendom: from this moment, when he proclaimed
himself head of the Church, he became harsh, and
cared for nothing but gratifying his evil inclinations,
his despotic humors, his blood-thirsty cruelty. As a
<i>prince</i>, he had at times shown a few amiable qualities;
as a <i>pope</i>, he was nothing but a tyrant.</p>

<p>Henry VIII. observing the agitation his pretensions
caused in England, and wishing to strengthen his new
authority, had caused several bills concerning the
Church to be brought into the parliament, which met
on the 3rd of November, 1534. The ministers who had
drafted them, far from being protestants, were zealous
partisans of scholastic orthodoxy. It was the cunning
Gardiner, a furious Catholic; the duke of Norfolk who
assisted in the king's movements against Rome, only to
prevent him from falling into the arms of the reformers;
and the politic Cromwell, who, despite his zeal against
the pope, declared at his death, possibly giving a particular
meaning to the words, that he died in the
catholic faith.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_96" id="Ref_96" href="#Foot_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The first act passed by parliament was the ratification
of the king's new title, already officially recognized by
the clergy. Henry's ministers knew how to make the
law strict and rigorous. 'It is enacted,' so ran the act,
'that our lord the king be acknowledged sole and
supreme head on earth of the Church of England; that
he shall possess not only the honors, jurisdictions, and
profits attached to that dignity, but also full authority
to put down all heresies and enormities, whatever be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
the customs and the laws that may be opposed to it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_97" id="Ref_97" href="#Foot_97">[97]</a></span>
Shortly after, on the 1st of February, parliament still
more imperious, enacted that 'whoever should do anything
tending to deprive the king or his heirs of any of
their titles, or should call him heretic, schismatic, usurper,
&amp;c., should be guilty of high treason.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_98" id="Ref_98" href="#Foot_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE KING, NOT HEAD OF THE CHURCH.=</p>

<p>Thus Henry VIII. united the two swords in his
hand.—'A Mohammedan union,' says a modern historian.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_99" id="Ref_99" href="#Foot_99">[99]</a></span>
This writer might have contented himself
with calling it 'a papal union.' Whether a pope claims
to be king, or a king claims to be pope, it comes to
nearly the same thing. At the time when the Reformation
was emancipating the long-enslaved Church, a
new master was given it, and what a master! The
consciences of Christians revolted against this order of
things. One day—it was some time later—Cranmer
was asked: 'Who is the supreme head of the Church of
England?'—'Christ,' was the reply, 'as He is of the
universal Church.'—'But did you not recognize the king
as supreme head of the Church?'—'We recognized him
as head of <i>all the people of England</i>,' answered Cranmer,
'of <i>churchmen</i> as well as of <i>laymen</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_100" id="Ref_100" href="#Foot_100">[100]</a></span>—
'What! not of
the Church?' 'No! <i>Supreme head of the Church</i> never
had any other meaning than what I tell you.' This is
explicit. If the title given Henry only signified that he
was king of the clergy as well as of the laity, and that
the former were under the jurisdiction of the royal
courts as well as the latter, in all matters of common
law, there can be nothing fairer. But how was it that
Cranmer did not find as much courage in Henry's lifetime
to speak according to his conscience, as when examined
in 1555 by Brokes, the papal sub-delegate? An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
interpretative document drawn up by the government at
almost the same time as the act of parliament, corroborates
however the explanation made by Cranmer; it
said: 'The title of supreme head of the Church gives
the king no new authority: it does not signify that he
can assume any spiritual power.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_101" id="Ref_101" href="#Foot_101">[101]</a></span>
This document
declares that the words <i>reform abuses and heresies</i>,
indicate the authority which the king possesses to
suppress the powers which the bishop of Rome or other
bishops have usurped in his realm. 'We heartily
detest,' said Fulke, master of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge,
'the notion that the king can do what he likes in
matters of religion.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_102" id="Ref_102" href="#Foot_102">[102]</a></span>
Even Elizabeth refused the title
of head of the Church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_103" id="Ref_103" href="#Foot_103">[103]</a></span>
Probably these are facts
which are not generally known.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">LIGHT FROM BOTH SIDES.<br />
 (<span class="smc">1534-1535.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">In</span> England it was reserved for Catholics as well as
for evangelicals to give the world, amid great misery,
remarkable examples of Christian virtues. Latimer and
others preached the truth courageously; martyrs like
Bilney, Tewkesbury, and Fryth had laid down their
lives for the Gospel. Now in the other party, laymen,
monks, and priests, with unquestionably a less enlightened
piety, were about to furnish proofs of their sincerity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
There were Roman martyrs also. Two armies
were in presence; many fell on both sides; but there
was a sensible difference between this spiritual war and
the wars of nations. Those who bit the dust did not
fall under the weapons of a hostile army; there was a
third power, the king-pope, who took his station between
the two lines, and dealt his blows now to the
right, now to the left. Leaders of the pontifical army
were to be smitten in the struggle in which so many
evangelicals had already fallen.</p>

<p class="side">=MORE'S WRETCHED CONDITION.=</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More, while in prison, strove to banish
afflicting thoughts by writing a history of Christ's passion.
One day when he came to these words of the
Gospel: <i>Then came they and laid hands on Jesus, and
took Him</i>, the door opened, and Kingston, the governor
of the Tower, accompanied by Rich, the attorney-general,
appeared. 'Sir Thomas,' said Rich, 'if an act of parliament
ordered all Englishmen to acknowledge me as
their king, would you acknowledge me?'—'Yes, sir.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_104" id="Ref_104" href="#Foot_104">[104]</a></span>—
'And if an act of parliament ordered all Englishmen
to recognize me as pope?'—'Parliament has no authority
to do it,' answered More. Sir Thomas held that an act
of parliament was sufficient to dethrone a king of England:
it is to a great grandson of More's that we are
indebted for this opinion, which a grand-nephew of
Cromwell put in practice a hundred years later. Was
Henry VIII. exasperated because More disposed so
freely of his crown? It is possible, but be that as it
may, the harshness of his imprisonment was increased.
Suffering preceded martyrdom. The illustrious scholar
was forced to pick up little scraps of paper on which to
write a few scattered thoughts with a coal.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_105" id="Ref_105" href="#Foot_105">[105]</a></span>
This was
not the worst. 'I have neither shirt nor sute,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_106" id="Ref_106" href="#Foot_106">[106]</a></span>
he
wrote to the chief secretary of state, 'nor yet other
clothes that are necessary for me to wear, but that be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
ragged and rent too shamefully. Notwithstanding, I
might easily suffer that if that would keep my body
warm. And now in my age my stomach may not away
but with a few kind of meats; which, if I want, I decay
forthwith, and fall into crases and diseases of my body,
and cannot keep myself in health.... I beseech you
be a good master unto me in my necessity, and let me
have such things as are necessary for me in mine age.
Restore me to my liberty out of this cold and painful
imprisonment. Let me have some priest to hear my
confession against this holy time, and some books to say
my devotions more effectually. The Lord send you a
merry Christmas.</p>

<p>'At the Tower, 23rd December.'</p>

<p>It is a relief to hope that this scandalous neglect proceeded
from heedlessness and not from cruelty. His
requests were granted.</p>

<p>While these sad scenes were enacted in the Tower,
there was great confusion in all England, where the
most opposite parties were in commotion. When the
traditional yoke was broken, every man raised up his
own banner. The friends of More and Fisher wished
to restore the papacy of the Roman bishop; Henry VIII.,
Cromwell, and the court thought how to establish the
supremacy of the king; finally, Cranmer and a few men
of the same stamp, endeavored to steer between these
quicksands, and aspired to introduce the reign of Holy
Scripture under the banner of royalty. This contest
between forces so different, complicated too by the passions
of the sovereign, was a terrible drama destined to
wind up not in a single catastrophe, but in many. Illustrious
victims, taken indiscriminately from all parties,
were to fall beneath the oft-repeated blows and be
buried in one common grave.</p>

<p>The prudent Cranmer lived in painful anxiety. Surrounded
by enemies who watched every step, he feared
to destroy the cause of truth, by undertaking reforms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
as extensive as those on the continent. The natural
timidity of his character, the compromises he thought
it his duty to make with regard to the hierarchy, his
fear of Henry VIII., his moderation, gentleness, and
plasticity of character and in some respects of principle,
prevented his applying to the work with the decision of
a Luther, a Calvin, or a Knox. Tyndale, if he had
possessed the influence that was his due, would have
accomplished a reform similar to that of those great
leaders. To have had him for a reformer would, in
Wickliffe's native land, have been the source of great
prosperity; but such a thing was impossible: his country
gave him—not a professor's chair but exile. Cranmer
moved forward slowly: he modified an evangelical
movement by a clerical concession. When he had
taken a step forward, he stopped suddenly, and apparently
drew back; not from cowardice, but because his
extreme prudence so urged him. The boldness of a
Farel or a Knox is in our opinion far more noble; and
yet this extreme moderation saved Cranmer and
protestantism with him. Near a throne like that of
Henry's, it was only a man of extreme precaution who
could have retained his position in the see of Canterbury.
If Cranmer should come into collision with the
Tudor's sceptre, he will find that it is a sword. God
gives to every people and to every epoch the man
necessary to it. Cranmer was this man for England, at
the time of her separation from the papacy. Notwithstanding
his compromises, he never abandoned the
great principles of the Reformation; notwithstanding
his concessions, he took advantage of every opportunity
to encourage those who shared his faith to march towards
a better future. The primate of England held
a torch in his hand which had not the brilliancy of that
borne by Luther and Calvin, but the tempest that blew
upon it for fifteen or twenty years could not extinguish
it. Sometimes he was seized with terror: as he heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
the lion roar, he bent his head, kept in the background,
and concealed the truth in his bosom; but again he
rose and again held out to the Church the light he had
saved from the fury of the tyrant. He was a reed and
not an oak—a reed that bent too easily, but through this
very weakness he was able to do what an oak with all
its strength would never have accomplished. The truth
triumphed.</p>

<p class="side">=TRANSLATION OF THE SCRIPTURES.=</p>

<p>At this time Cranmer thought himself in a position
to take a step—the most important step of all: he
undertook to give the Bible to the laity. When the
convocation of clergy and parliament had assembled,
he made a proposition that the Holy Scriptures should
be translated into English by certain honorable and
learned men, and be circulated among the people.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_107" id="Ref_107" href="#Foot_107">[107]</a></span>
To
present Holy Scripture as the supreme rule instead of
the pope, was a bold act that decided the evangelical reformation.
Stokesley, Gardiner, and the other bishops
of the catholic party cried out against such a monstrous
design: 'The teaching of the Church is sufficient,' they
said; 'we must prohibit Tyndale's Testament and the
heretical books which come to us from beyond the sea.'
The archbishop saw that he could only carry his point
by giving up something: he consented to a compromise.
Convocation resolved on the 19th of December, 1534, to
lay Cranmer's proposal before the king, but with the
addition that the Scriptures translated into the vulgar
tongue should only be circulated among the king's
subjects in proportion to their knowledge, and that all
who possessed suspected books should be bound to give
them up to the royal commissioners: others might have
called this resolution a defeat, Cranmer looked upon it as
a victory. The Scriptures would no longer be admitted
stealthily into the kingdom, like contraband goods: they
would appear in broad daylight with the royal sanction.
This was something.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span></p>

<p>Henry granted the petition of Convocation, but
hastened to profit by it. His great fixed idea was to
destroy the Roman papacy in England, not because of
its errors, but because he felt that it robbed princes of
the affection and often of the obedience of their subjects.
'If I grant my bishops what they ask for,' he said, 'in
my turn I ask them to make oath never to permit any
jurisdiction to be restored to the Roman bishop in my
kingdom; never to call him <i>pope</i>, universal <i>bishop</i>, or
most holy lord, but only bishop of Rome, colleague and
brother, according to the ancient custom of the oldest
bishops.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_108" id="Ref_108" href="#Foot_108">[108]</a></span>
All the prelates were eager to obey the king;
but the archbishop of York, secretly devoted to the
Roman Church, added, to acquit his conscience, 'that
he took the oath in order to preserve the unity of the
faith and of the Catholic Church.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_109" id="Ref_109" href="#Foot_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Cranmer was filled with joy by the victory he had
won. 'If we possess the Holy Scriptures,' he said, 'we
have at hand a remedy for every disease. Beset as we
are with tribulations and temptations, where can we find
arms to overcome them? In Scripture. It is the balm
that will heal our wounds, and will be a more precious
jewel in our houses than either gold or silver.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_110" id="Ref_110" href="#Foot_110">[110]</a></span>
He
therefore turned his mind at once to the realization of
the plan he had so much at heart. Taking for groundwork
an existing translation (doubtless that by Tyndale),
he divided the New Testament into ten portions, had
each transcribed separately, and transmitted them to
the most learned of the bishops, praying that they
might be returned to him with their remarks. He even
thought it his duty not to omit such decided catholics as
Stokesley and Gardiner.</p>

<p class="side">=SEDITIOUS PRIESTS AND PREACHERS.=</p>

<p>The day appointed for the return and examination of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
these various portions having arrived (June 1553),
Cranmer set to work, and found that the <i>Acts of the
Apostles</i> were wanting: they had fallen to the lot of the
bishop of London. When the primate's secretary went
to ask for the manuscript, Stokesley replied in a very
bad humor: 'I do not understand my lord of Canterbury.
By giving the people the Holy Scriptures, he
will plunge them into heresy. I certainly will not give
an hour to such a task. Here, take the book back to
my lord.' When the secretary delivered his message,
Thomas Lawness, one of Cranmer's friends, said with a
smile: 'My lord of London will not take the trouble to
examine the Scriptures, persuaded that there is nothing
for him in the Testament of Jesus Christ.' Many of the
portions returned by the other bishops were pitiable.
The archbishop saw that he must find colleagues better
disposed.</p>

<p>Cranmer had soon to discharge another function. As
popery and rebellion were openly preached in the
dioceses of Winchester and London,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_111" id="Ref_111" href="#Foot_111">[111]</a></span>
the metropolitan
announced his intention to visit them. The two bishops
cried out vehemently, and Gardiner hurried to the
king: 'Your Grace,' he said, 'here is a new pope!' All
who had anything to fear began to reproach the primate
with aspiring to honors and dominion. 'God forgive
me,' he said with simplicity, 'if there is any title in the
world I care for more than <i>the paring of an apple</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_112" id="Ref_112" href="#Foot_112">[112]</a></span>
Neither paper, parchment, lead, nor wax, but the very
Christian conversation of the people, are the letters and
seals of our office.' The king supported Cranmer,
knowing that certain of the clergy preached submission
to the pope. The visitation took place. Even in London
priests were found who had taken the oath prescribed
by Henry VIII., and who yet 'made a god of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
the Roman pontiff,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_113" id="Ref_113" href="#Foot_113">[113]</a></span>
 setting his power and his laws
above those of our Lord.' 'I command you,' said the
king, 'to lay hold of all who circulate those pernicious
doctrines.'</p>

<p>Francis I. watched these severities from afar. He
feared they would render an alliance between France
and England impossible. He therefore sent Bryon,
high-admiral of France, to London, to reconcile the
king with the pope, to strengthen the bonds that united
the two countries, and at the same time, he prevailed
upon Paul III. to withdraw the decree of Clement VII.
against Henry VIII.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_114" id="Ref_114" href="#Foot_114">[114]</a></span>
But success did not crown his
efforts: the king of England had no great confidence in
the sincerity of the pope or of the French king. He was
well pleased to be no longer confronted by a foreign
authority in his own dominions, and thought that his
people would never give up the Reformation. Instead
of being reconciled with the Roman pontiff, he found it
more convenient to imitate the pope, and to break out
against those subjects who refused to recognize him,
the king, as head of the Church.</p>

<p class="side">=RESOLUTION OF THE CARTHUSIANS.=</p>

<p>He first attacked the Carthusians, the most respectable
of the religious orders in England, and whom he
considered as the most dangerous. Where there was
the most goodness, there was also the most strength;
and that strength gave umbrage to the despotic Tudor
king.</p>

<p>Monastic life, abominable in its abuses, was, even in
principle, contrary to the Gospel. But we must confess
that there was a certain harmony between the wants of
society in the Middle Ages and conventual establishments.
Many and various motives drove into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
cloisters the men that filled them; and if some were
condemnable, there were others whose value deserves to
be appreciated. It was these earnest monks who, even
while defending the royalty of the pope, rejected most
energetically the papacy of the king: this was enough
to draw down upon them the royal vengeance. One
day a messenger from the court brought to the Charter-House
of London an order to reject the Roman authority.
The monks, summoned by their prior, remained
silent when they heard the message, and their features
alone betrayed the trouble of their minds.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_115" id="Ref_115" href="#Foot_115">[115]</a></span>
'My heart
is full of sorrow,' said Prior Haughton. 'What are we
to do? If we resist the king, our house will be shut up,
and you young men will be cast into the midst of the
world, so that after commencing here in the spirit you
will end there in the flesh. But, on the other hand, how
can we obey? Alas! I am helpless to save those whom
God has entrusted to my care!' At these words the
Carthusians 'fell all a-weeping;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_116" id="Ref_116" href="#Foot_116">[116]</a></span>
and then taking courage
from the presence of danger they said: 'We will
perish together in our integrity; and heaven and earth
shall cry out against the injustice that oppresses us.'—'Would
to God it might be so,' exclaimed the Superior;
'but this is what they will do. They will put me to
death—me and the oldest of us—and they will turn the
younger ones into the world, which will teach them its
wicked works. I am ready to give up my life to save
you; but if one death does not satisfy the king, then let
us all die!'—'Yes, we will all die,' answered the
brethren.—'And now let us make preparation by a
general confession,' said the prior, 'so that the Lord
may find us ready.'</p>

<p>Next morning the chapel-doors opened and all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
monks marched in. Their serious looks, their pale
countenances, their fixed eyes seemed to betoken men
who were awaiting their last moments. The prior went
into the pulpit and read the sixtieth Psalm: '<i>O God,
thou hast cast us off.</i>' On coming to the end, he said:
'My brethren, we must die in charity. Let us pardon
another.' At these words Haughton came down from
the pulpit, and knelt in succession before every brother,
saying: 'O my brother, I beg your forgiveness of all my
offences!' The other monks, each in his turn, made
this last confession.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards they celebrated the mass of the
Holy Ghost. Immediately after the elevation, the
monks fancied they heard 'a small hissing wind.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_117" id="Ref_117" href="#Foot_117">[117]</a></span>
Their hearts were filled with a tender affection: they
believed that the Holy Ghost was descending upon
them, and the prior, touched by this surprising grace,
burst into tears. Enthusiasm mingled extraordinary
fantasies with their pious emotions.</p>

<p>The king had evidently not much to fear in this
quarter. His crown was threatened by more formidable
enemies. In various parts, especially in Lincolnshire
and Yorkshire,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_118" id="Ref_118" href="#Foot_118">[118]</a></span>
there were daring partisans of the
papacy to be found who endeavored to stir up the
people to revolt; and thousands of Englishmen in the
North were ready to help them by force of arms. At
the same time Ireland wished to transport her soldiers
across St. George's Channel and hurl the king from his
throne. The decision with which Fisher, Sir Thomas
More, and the Carthusians resisted Henry had not immediate
insurrection for its object, but it encouraged the
multitude to revolt. The government thinking, therefore,
that it was time to strike, sent the Carthusians an
absolute order to acknowledge the royal supremacy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ROME AND LIBERTY INCOMPATIBLE.=</p>

<p>At this time there was in reality no liberty on one
side or the other. Rome, by not granting it, was consistent
with herself; but not so the protestantism that
denies it. The Reformation, acknowledging no other
sovereign Lord and Teacher than God, must of necessity
leave the conscience to that Supreme Master, man having
nothing to do with it. But the Roman Church,
acknowledging a man as its head, and honoring the
pope as the representative of God on earth, claims authority
over the soul. Men may say in vain that they
are in harmony with God and His Word: that is not
the question. The great business is to be in accord with
the pope. That old man, throned in the Vatican on the
traditions of the School and the bulls of his predecessors,
is their judge: they are bound to follow exactly his
line, without wavering either to the right or the left.
If they reject an article, a jot of a papal constitution,
they must be cast away. Such a system, the enemy of
every liberty, even of the most legitimate, rose in the
sixteenth century like a high wall to separate Rome
and the new generation. It threatened to destroy in the
future that power which had triumphed in the past.</p>

<p>After the festival of Easter 1535, the heads of two
other Carthusian houses—Robert Laurence, prior of
Belleval, and Augustine Webster, prior of Axholm—arrived
in London in obedience to an order they had
received, and, in company with Prior Haughton, waited
upon Cromwell. As they refused to acknowledge the
royal supremacy, they were sent to the Tower. A week
later, they consented to take the oath, adding: 'So far
as God's law permits.'—'No restrictions,' answered
Cromwell. On the 29th of April they were placed on
their trial, when they said: 'We will never believe anything
contrary to the law of God and the teaching of
our holy mother Church.' At first the jury expressed
some interest in their behalf; but Haughton uselessly
embittered his position. 'You can only produce in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
favor of your opinion,' he said, 'the parliament of one
single kingdom; for mine, I can produce all Christendom.'
The jury found the three prisoners guilty of
high-treason.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_119" id="Ref_119" href="#Foot_119">[119]</a></span>
Thence the government proceeded to
more eminent victims.</p>

<p>Fisher and More, confined in the same prison, were
now treated with more consideration.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_120" id="Ref_120" href="#Foot_120">[120]</a></span>
It was said,
however, that these illustrious captives were endeavoring,
even in the Tower, to excite the people to revolt.
The king and Cromwell could hardly have believed it,
but they imagined that if these two leading men gave
way, their example would carry the recalcitrants with
them: they were therefore exposed to a new examination.
But they proved as obstinate as their adversaries,
and perhaps more skilful. 'I have no more to do with
the titles to be given to popes and princes,' said Sir
Thomas; 'my thoughts are with God alone.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_121" id="Ref_121" href="#Foot_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The court hoped to intimidate these eminent personages
by the execution of the three priors, which took
place on the 4th May, 1535. Margaret hurried to her
father's side. Before long the procession passed under
his window, and the affectionate young woman used
every means to draw Sir Thomas away from the sight;
but he would not avert his eyes. When all was over,
he turned to his daughter: 'Meg,' he said, 'you saw
those saintly fathers; they went as cheerfully to death
as if they were bridegrooms going to be married.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_122" id="Ref_122" href="#Foot_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=EXECUTION OF THE CARTHUSIANS.=</p>

<p>The prisoners walked calmly along: they wore their
clerical robes, the ceremony of degradation not having
been performed, no doubt to show that a papal consecration
could not protect offenders. Haughton, prior
of the London Charter-House, mounted the ladder first.
'I pray all who hear me,' he said, 'to bear witness for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
me in the terrible day of judgment, that it is not out of
obstinate malice or rebellion that I disobey the king,
but only for the fear of God.' The rope was now
placed round his neck. 'Holy Jesus!' he exclaimed,
'have mercy on me,' and he gave up the ghost. The
other priors then stepped forward. 'God has manifested
great grace to us,' they said, 'by calling us to die
in defence of the catholic faith. No, the king is not
head of the Church of England.' A few minutes later
and these monks, dressed in the robes of their order,
were swinging in the air. This was one of the crimes
committed when the unlawful tiara of the pontiffs was
placed unlawfully on the head of a king of England.
Other Carthusians were put to death somewhat later.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Henry VIII. desired to preserve a balance
between papists and heretics. The Roman tribunals
struck one side only, but this strange prince gloried in
striking both sides at once. An opportunity of doing so
occurred. Some anabaptists from the Low Countries
were convicted on the 25th of May: two of them were
taken to Smithfield and twelve others sent to different
cities, where they suffered the punishment by fire. All
of them went to death with cheerful hearts.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_123" id="Ref_123" href="#Foot_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The turn of the illustrious captives was at hand.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">EXECUTION OF BISHOP FISHER AND SIR THOMAS MORE.<br />
 (<span class="smc">May to September 1535.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">Not</span> long after the death of the Carthusians, Cromwell
paid More a visit. Henry VIII. loved his former
chancellor, and desired to save his life. 'I am your
friend,' said Cromwell, 'and the king is a good and
gracious lord towards you.' He then once again invited
More to accept the act of parliament which proclaimed
the king's supremacy; and the same steps were
taken with Fisher. Both refused what was asked.
From that moment the execution of the sentence could
not be long delayed. More felt this, and as soon as the
Secretary of State had left him, he took a piece of coal
and wrote some verses upon the wall, expressive of the
peace of his soul.</p>

<p class="side">=FISHER'S LAST DAYS.=</p>

<p>Henry and his minister seemed however to hesitate.
It had not troubled them much to punish a few papists
and obscure anabaptists; but to put to death an ex-chancellor
of the realm and an old tutor of the king—both
personages so illustrious and so esteemed throughout
Christendom—was another thing. Several weeks
passed away. It was an act of the pope's that hastened
the death of these two men. About the 20th of May,
Paul III. created a certain number of cardinals: John
Du Bellay, Contarini, Caracciolo, and lastly, Fisher,
bishop of Rochester. The news of this creation burst
upon Rome and London like a clap of thunder. Da
Casale, Henry's agent at the papal court, exclaimed that
it was offering his master the greatest affront possible:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
the matter was the talk of the whole city.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_124" id="Ref_124" href="#Foot_124">[124]</a></span>
'Your
holiness has never committed a more serious mistake
than this,' said Da Casale to the pope.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_125" id="Ref_125" href="#Foot_125">[125]</a></span>
Paul tried to
justify himself. As England desired to become reconciled
with the Vatican, he said, it seemed to him that
he could not do better than nominate an English cardinal.
When Fisher heard the news, he said piously:
'If the cardinal's hat were at my feet, I would not
stoop to pick it up.' But Henry did not take the
matter so calmly: he considered Paul's proceedings as
an insolent challenge. Confer the highest honors on a
man convicted of treason—is it not encouraging subjects
to revolt? Henry seemed to have thought that it
would be unnecessary to take away the life of an old
man whose end could not be far off; but the pope exasperated
and braved him. Since they place Fisher
among the cardinals in Rome, in England he shall be
counted among the dead. Paul may, as long as he
likes, send him the hat; but when the hat arrives, there
shall be no head on which to place it.<span

<p>On the 14th of June, 1535, Thomas Bedell and other
officers of justice proceeded to the Tower. The bishop
would give no answer to the demand that he should
recognize the king as head of the Church. Sir Thomas
More, when questioned in his turn, replied: 'My only
study is to meditate on Christ's passion.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_127" id="Ref_127" href="#Foot_127">[127]</a></span>
'Do you
acknowledge the king as supreme head of the Church?'
asked Bedell. 'The royal supremacy is established by
law.'—'That law is a two-edged sword,' returned the
ex-chancellor. 'If I accept it, it kills my soul; if I reject
it, it kills my body.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_128" id="Ref_128" href="#Foot_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Three days later the bishop was condemned to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
beheaded. When the order for his execution arrived,
the prisoner was asleep: they respected his slumber.
At five o'clock the next morning, 22nd of June, 1535,
Kingston entering his cell, aroused him and told him
that it was the king's good pleasure he should be executed
that morning. 'I most humbly thank his
Majesty,' said the old man, 'that he is pleased to relieve
me from all the affairs of this world. Grant me only an
hour or two more, for I slept very badly last night.'
Then turning towards the wall, he fell asleep again.
Between seven and eight o'clock he called his servant,
took off the hair-shirt which he wore next his skin to
mortify the flesh, and gave it to the man. 'Let no one
see it,' he said. 'And now bring me my best clothes.'—'My
lord,' said the astonished servant, 'does not your
lordship know that in two hours you will take them off
never to put them on again?'—'Exactly so,' answered
Fisher; 'this is my wedding-day, and I ought to dress
as if for a holiday.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_129" id="Ref_129" href="#Foot_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FISHER'S CHRISTIAN DEATH.=</p>

<p>At nine o'clock the lieutenant appeared. The old
man took up his New Testament, made the sign of the
cross, and left the cell. He was tall, being six feet high,
but his body was bent with age, and his weakness so
great that he could hardly get down the stairs. He was
placed in an arm-chair. When the porters stopped
near the gate of the Tower to know if the sheriffs were
ready, Fisher stood up, and leaning against the wall
opened his Testament, and lifting his eyes to heaven, he
said: 'O Lord! I open it for the last time. Grant that
I may find some word of comfort to the end that I may
glorify thee in my last hour.' The first words he saw
were these: <i>And this is life eternal, that they might know
thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast
sent</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_130" id="Ref_130" href="#Foot_130">[130]</a></span>
Fisher closed the book and said: 'That will do.
Here is learning enough to last me to my life's end.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_131" id="Ref_131" href="#Foot_131">[131]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span></p>

<p>The funeral procession was set in motion. Clouds hid
the face of the sun; the day was gloomy; the streets
through which they passed seemed dull and in harmony
with men's hearts. A large body of armed men surrounded
the pious old man, who kept repeating in a low
tone the words of his Testament: <i>Hæc est autem vita
æterna, ut cognoscant te solum Deum et quem misisti Jesum
Christum</i>. They reached Smithfield. 'We will help
you to ascend,' said his bearers at the foot of the
scaffold. 'No, sirs,' he replied, and then added in a
cheerful tone: 'Come, feet! do your duty, you have not
far to go.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_132" id="Ref_132" href="#Foot_132">[132]</a></span>
Just as he mounted the scaffold, the sun
burst out and shone upon his face: <i>They looked unto
him and were lightened</i>, he cried, <i>and their faces were not
ashamed</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_133" id="Ref_133" href="#Foot_133">[133]</a></span>
It was ten o'clock. The noble bearing and
piety of the aged bishop inspired all around him with
respect. The executioner knelt before him and begged
his forgiveness. 'With all my heart,' he made answer.
Having laid aside his robe and furred gown, he turned
to the people, and said with gravity and joy: 'Christians,
I give my life for my faith in the holy catholic
Church of Christ. I do not fear death. Assist me,
however, with your prayers, so that when the axe falls I
may remain firm. God save the king and the kingdom!'
The brightness of his face at this moment struck the
spectators. He fell on his knees and said: 'Eternal
God, my hope is in thy deliverance.' The executioner
approached and bound his eyes. The bishop raised his
hands, uttered a cry towards heaven, and laid his head
on the block. The doomsman seized his heavy axe, and
cut off the head at one blow. It was exposed by
Henry's orders on London bridge; but soldiers carried
the body to Barking church-yard, where they dug a
lowly grave for it with their halberds. Doubts have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
been thrown upon the details of this death; we believe
them to be authentic, and it is a pleasure by reporting
them to place a crown on the tomb of a Roman-catholic
bishop whose end was that of a pious man.</p>

<p>It was now the turn of Sir Thomas More. On the
1st of July, 1535, he was summoned before the court
of King's Bench. The former Chancellor of England
quitted his prison in a frieze cloak, which had grown
foul in the dungeon, and proceeded on foot through
the most frequented streets of London on his road to
Westminster. His thin pale face; his white hair, the
effect not of time but of sorrow and imprisonment; the
staff on which he leant,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_134" id="Ref_134" href="#Foot_134">[134]</a></span>
for he walked with difficulty,
made a deep impression on the people. When he
arrived at the bar of that tribunal over which he had
so often presided, and looked around him, though
weakened by suffering, with a countenance full of mildness,
all the spectators were moved. The indictment
was long and perplexed:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_135" id="Ref_135" href="#Foot_135">[135]</a></span>
he was accused of high-treason.
Sir Thomas, endeavoring to keep on his feet,
said: 'My Lords, the charges brought against me are
so numerous, that I fear, considering my great weakness,
I shall be unable to remember them all.' He
stopped: his body trembled and he was near falling. A
chair was brought him, and after taking his seat, he
continued: 'I have never uttered a single word in
opposition to the statute which proclaims the king head
of the Church.'—'If we cannot produce your words,'
said the king's attorney, 'we can produce your silence.'—'No
one can be condemned for his silence,' nobly
answered More. '<i>Qui tacet consentire videtur</i>, Silence
gives consent, according to the lawyers.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_136" id="Ref_136" href="#Foot_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=SIR THOMAS MORE SENTENCED.=</p>

<p>Nothing could save him: the jury returned a verdict
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
of guilty. 'Now that all is over,' said the prisoner, 'I
will speak. Yes, the oath of supremacy is illegal. The
Great Charter laid down that <i>the Church of England is
free</i>, so that its rights and liberties might be equally
preserved.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_137" id="Ref_137" href="#Foot_137">[137]</a></span>—
'The Church must be <i>free</i>,' said the lawyers:
'it is not therefore the slave of the pope.'—'Yes,
<i>free</i>,' retorted More; 'it is not therefore the slave of the
king.' The chancellor then pronounced sentence, condemning
him to be hanged at Tyburn, and then quartered,
while still alive. Henry spared his illustrious
subject and old friend from this cruel punishment, and
ordered that he should be merely beheaded. 'God save
all my friends from his Majesty's favor,' said Sir
Thomas, 'and spare my children from similar indulgences....
I hope, my lords,' said the ex-chancellor,
turning meekly towards his judges, 'that though you
have condemned me on earth, we may all meet hereafter
in heaven.'</p>

<p>Sir William Kingston approached; armed guards
surrounded the condemned man, and the sad procession
moved forward. One of the Tower wardens marched in
front, bearing an axe with the edge turned towards
More;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_138" id="Ref_138" href="#Foot_138">[138]</a></span>
it was a token to the people of the prisoner's
fate. As soon as he crossed the threshold of the court,
his son, who was waiting for him, fell at his feet distracted
and in tears: 'Your blessing, father,' he exclaimed,
'your blessing!' More raised him up, kissed him
tenderly, and blessed him. His daughter Margaret was
not there: she had fainted immediately on hearing of her
father's condemnation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_139" id="Ref_139" href="#Foot_139">[139]</a></span>
He was taken back to prison
in a boat, perhaps to withdraw this innocent and illustrious
man, treated like a criminal, from the eyes of the
citizens of London. When they got near the Tower, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
governor, who had until then kept his emotion under,
turned to More and bade him farewell, the tears running
down his cheeks.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_140" id="Ref_140" href="#Foot_140">[140]</a></span>
'My dear Kingston,' said the
noble prisoner, 'do not weep; we shall meet again in
heaven.'—'Yes!' said the lieutenant of the Tower, adding:
'you are consoling me, when I ought to console
you.' An immense crowd covered the wharf at which
the boat was to land. Among this crowd, so eager for
the mournful spectacle, was a young woman, trembling
with emotion and silently waiting for the procession: it
was Margaret. At length she heard the steps of the
approaching guards, and saw her father appear. She
could not move, her strength failed her; she fell on her
knees just where she had stood. Her father, who
recognized her at a distance, giving way to the keenest
emotions, lifted up his hands and blessed her. This
was not enough for Margaret. The blessing had caused
a strong emotion in her, and had restored life to her
soul. Regardless of her sex, her age, and the surrounding
crowd, that feeble woman, to whom at this supreme
moment filial piety gave the strength of many men, says
a contemporary,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_141" id="Ref_141" href="#Foot_141">[141]</a></span>
flew towards her father, and bursting
through the officers and halberdiers by whom he was
surrounded,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_142" id="Ref_142" href="#Foot_142">[142]</a></span>
fell on his neck and embraced him, exclaiming:
'Father, father!' She could say no more;
grief stopped her voice: she could only weep, and her
tears fell on her father's bosom.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_143" id="Ref_143" href="#Foot_143">[143]</a></span>
The soldiers halted
in emotion; Sir Thomas, the prey at once of the tenderest
love and inexpressible grief, felt as if a sword
had pierced his heart.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_144" id="Ref_144" href="#Foot_144">[144]</a></span>
Recovering himself, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
he blessed his child, and said to her in a voice whose
emotion he strove to conceal: 'Daughter, I am innocent;
but remember that however hard the blow with
which I am struck, it comes from God. Submit thy
will to the good pleasure of the Lord.'</p>

<p class="side">=MORE AND HIS DAUGHTER.=</p>

<p>The captain of the escort, wishing to put an end to a
scene that might agitate the people, bade two soldiers
take Margaret away; but she clung to her father with
arms that were like bars of iron, and it was with difficulty
that she could be removed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_145" id="Ref_145" href="#Foot_145">[145]</a></span>
She had been hardly
set on the ground a few steps off, when she sprang up
again, and thrusting those who had separated her from
him she so loved, she broke through the crowd once
more, fell upon his neck, and kissed him several times
with a convulsive effort. In her, filial love had all the
vehemence of passion. More, whom the sentence of
death had not been able to move, lost all energy, and
the tears poured down his cheeks. The crowd watched
this touching scene with deep excitement, and 'they
were very few in all the troop who could refrain from
weeping; no, not the guards themselves.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_146" id="Ref_146" href="#Foot_146">[146]</a></span>
Even the
soldiers wept, and refused to tear the daughter again
from her father's arms. Two or three, however, of the
less agitated stepped forward and carried Margaret
away. The women of her household, who had accompanied
her, immediately surrounded her and bore her
away from a sight of such inexpressible sadness. The
prisoner entered the Tower.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas spent six more days and nights in prison.
We hear certainly of his pious words, but the petty
practices of an ascetic seemed to engross him too much.
His macerations were increased: he walked up and
down his cell, wearing only a winding-sheet as if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
were already a corpse waiting to be buried.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_147" id="Ref_147" href="#Foot_147">[147]</a></span>
He often
scourged himself for a long time together, and with
extraordinary violence. Yet at the same time he indulged
in Christian meditations. 'I am afflicted,' he
wrote to one of his friends, 'shut up in a dungeon; but
God in His mercy will soon deliver me from this world
of tribulation. Walls will no longer separate us, and we
shall have holy conversations together, which no jailer
will interrupt.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_148" id="Ref_148" href="#Foot_148">[148]</a></span>
On the 5th of July, desiring to bid his
daughter a last farewell, More took a piece of charcoal
(he had nothing else), and wrote to her: 'To-morrow
is St. Thomas's day, and my saint's day; accordingly, I
desire extremely that it may be the day of my departure.
My child, I never loved you so dearly as when last you
kissed me. I like when daughterly love has no leisure
to look unto worldly courtesy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_149" id="Ref_149" href="#Foot_149">[149]</a></span>
... Farewell, my
dearly beloved daughter; pray for me. I pray for you
all, to the end that we may meet in heaven.'</p>

<p>Thus one of the closest and holiest affections, that of
a father for his daughter, and of a daughter for her
father, softened the last moments of this distinguished
man. Sir Thomas sent Margaret his hair-shirt and
scourge, which he desired to conceal from the eyes of
the indifferent. What an inheritance!</p>

<p>That night he slept quietly, and the next morning
early (6th of July, 1535), a fortnight after the death of
the bishop, Sir Thomas Pope, one of his familiar friends,
came to inform him that he must hold himself in readiness.
'I thank the king,' said More, 'for shutting me
up in this prison, whereby he has put me in a condition
to make suitable preparation for death. The only favor
I beg of him is, that my daughter may be present at my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
burial.' Pope left the cell in tears. Then the prisoner
put on a fine silk robe which his wealthy friend Bonvisi,
the merchant of Lucca, had given him. 'Leave that
dress here,' said Kingston, 'for the man to whom it falls
by custom is only a jailer.'—'I cannot look upon that
man as a jailer,' answered More, 'who opens the gates
of heaven for me.'</p>

<p class="side">=EXECUTION OF SIR THOMAS MORE.=</p>

<p>At nine o'clock the procession quitted the Tower.
More was calm, his face pale, his beard long and curly;
he carried a crucifix in his hand, and his eyes were
often turned towards heaven. A numerous and sympathizing
crowd watched him pass along—a man one
time so honored, lord chancellor, lord chief-justice,
president of the house of Lords—whom armed men
were now leading to the scaffold. Just as he was passing
in front of a house of mean appearance, a poor
woman standing at the door, went up to him and offered
him a cup of wine to strengthen him: 'Thank you,' he
said gently, 'thank you; Christ drank vinegar only.'
On arriving at the place of execution: 'Give me your
hand to help me up,' he said to Kingston, adding: 'As
for my coming down, you may let me shift for myself.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_150" id="Ref_150" href="#Foot_150">[150]</a></span>
He mounted the scaffold. Sir Thomas Pope, at the
king's request, had begged him to make no speech,
fearing the effect this illustrious man might produce
upon the people. More desired however to say a few
words, but the sheriff stopped him. 'I die,' he was
content to say, 'in the faith of the catholic Church, and
a faithful servant of God and the king.' He then knelt
down and repeated the fifty-first Psalm:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_151" id="Ref_151" href="#Foot_151">[151]</a></span>
<i>Have mercy
upon me, O God, according to thy loving-kindness: according
unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions</i>. When he rose up, the executioner begged
his forgiveness: 'Why do you talk of forgiveness?'
replied More; 'you are doing me the greatest kindness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
I ever received from man.' He desired the man not to
be afraid to do his office, and remarked that his neck
was very short. With his own hands he fastened a
bandage over his eyes, and then laid his head on the
block. The executioner, holding the axe, was preparing
to strike, when More stopped him, and putting his
beard carefully on one side, said: 'This at least has not
committed treason.' Such words, almost jesting, no
doubt, startle us at such a moment; but strong men
have often been observed to manifest the calmness of
their souls in such a manner. More probably feared
that his long beard would embarrass the executioner,
and deaden the blow. At length that head fell, through
which so many noble thoughts had passed; that keen
clear eye was closed; those eloquent lips were the lips
of a corpse. The head was exposed on London bridge,
and Margaret discharged the painful duty her father
had bequeathed her, by piously burying his body.</p>

<p class="side">=HENRY'S VICTIMS.=</p>

<p>Thus, at the cost of his life, this eminent man protested
against the aberrations of a cruel prince, who
usurped the title given by the Bible to Jesus Christ
alone. The many evangelical martyrs who had been
sacrificed in different countries and who were to be
sacrificed, showed in general, to a greater extent than
Fisher and More, an ardent love for the Saviour, a lively
hope of eternal life; but none showed greater calmness
than they. These two good men wanted discernment
as to what constitutes the pure Gospel; their piety
bound them too much, as we have said, to monastic
practices; they had (and More especially) in the days
of their power persecuted the disciples of the Lord, and
though they rejected the usurpations of the king, had
acted as fanatical defenders of those of the pope. But
at a time when there were so many cringing bishops and
servile nobles—when almost every one bent the head
timidly before the mad popery of Henry VIII., these two
firmly held up theirs. More and Fisher were companions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
in misfortune with Bilney and Fryth: the same
royal hand struck them all. Our sympathies are for the
victims, our aversion for the executioner.</p>

<p>The death of these two celebrated men caused an
immense sensation. In England, the people and even
the nobility were struck with astonishment. Could it be
true, men asked, that Thomas More, whom Henry had
known since he was nine years old, with whom he used
to hold friendly conversations by night on the terrace
of his country-house, at whose table he used to love to
sit down familiarly, whom he had chosen, although a
layman and a knight only, to succeed the powerful
Wolsey:—could it be true that by the king's orders he
had perished by the axe? Could it be true that Fisher
had met with the same fate—that venerable old man of
fourscore years, who had been his preceptor, the trusty
friend of his grandmother, and to whose teaching he
owed the progress he had made in learning? Men
began to see that resistance to a Tudor was the scaffold.
Every one trembled, and even those who had not known
the two victims could not restrain their tears.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_152" id="Ref_152" href="#Foot_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>The horror which these executions caused among the
enlightened men of the continent was displayed with
more liberty and energy. 'I am dead,' exclaimed
Erasmus, 'since More is dead: for, as Pythagoras says,
we had but one soul between us.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_153" id="Ref_153" href="#Foot_153">[153]</a></span>—'O
England! O dearly beloved country,' said Reginald Pole; 'he was
not only Margaret's father, but thine also!'—'This year
is fatal to our order,' said Melanchthon the reformer;
'I hear that More has been killed and others also. You
know how such things wring my heart.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_154" id="Ref_154" href="#Foot_154">[154]</a></span>—'We
banish such criminals,' said Francis I. sharply to the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
ambassador, 'but we do not put them to death.'—'If I
had two such lights in my kingdom,' said Charles V., 'I
would sooner give two of my strongest cities than suffer
them to be extinguished.' At Rome in particular the
anger was terrible. They were still flattering themselves
that Henry VIII. would return to his old sympathies;
but now there was no more hope! The king
had put to death a prince of the Church, and as he had
sworn, the cardinal's hat could find no head to wear it.
A consistory was immediately summoned: Cardinal de
Tournon's touching letter was read, and all who heard
it were moved even to tears. The embarrassed and
speechless agents of England knew not what to do; and
as they reported, there was everything to be feared.</p>

<p>Perhaps nobody was so confounded as the pontiff.
Paul III. was circumspect, prudent, deliberative, and
temporizing; but when he thought the moment arrived,
when he believed further manœuvring was not required,
he no longer hesitated, but struck forcibly. It is known
that he had two young relations whom, in his blind tenderness,
he had created cardinals, notwithstanding their
youth and the emperor's representations. 'Alas!' he
exclaimed, 'I feel as mortally injured, as if my two
nephews had been killed before my eyes.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_155" id="Ref_155" href="#Foot_155">[155]</a></span>
His most
devoted partisans, and above all a cardinal of his creation
put to death! There was a violent movement in his
heart; he worked himself into a fury; he desired to
strike the prince whose cruel deeds had wounded him
so deeply. His anger burst out in a thunder-clap. On
the 30th of August he issued a bull worthy of Gregory VII.,
which the more zealous partisans of the papacy
would like to remove from the papal records.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_156" id="Ref_156" href="#Foot_156">[156]</a></span>
'Let
King Henry repent of his crimes,' said the pontiff; 'we
give him ninety days and his accomplices sixty to appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
at Rome. In case of default, we strike him with
the sword of anathema, of malediction, and of eternal
damnation;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_157" id="Ref_157" href="#Foot_157">[157]</a></span>
we take away his kingdom from him; we
declare that his body shall be deprived of ecclesiastical
burial; we launch an interdict against his States; we
release his subjects from their oath of fidelity; we call
upon all dukes, marquises and earls to expel him and
his accomplices from England; we unbind all Christian
princes from their oaths towards him, command them
to march against him and constrain him to return to the
obedience due to the Holy Apostolic See, giving them
all his goods for their reward, and he and his to be
their slaves.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_158" id="Ref_158" href="#Foot_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Anger had the same effect upon the pontiff as
inebriety; he had lost the use of his reason, and allowed
himself to be carried away to threats and excesses of
which he would have been ashamed, had he been sober.
Accordingly the drunkenness was hardly over, before
the unfortunate Paul hastened to hide his bull, and
carefully laid aside his thunderbolts in the arsenal, free
to bring them out later.</p>

<p class="side">=HENRY'S PALTRY EXCUSES.=</p>

<p>Henry VIII., more calm than the pope, having heard
of his discontent, feared to push him to extremities;
and Cromwell, a month after the date of the bull,
instructed Da Casale to justify the king to the Vatican.
'Fisher and More,' he was to say, 'had on all points of
the internal policy of England come to conclusions
diametrically opposed to the quiet and prosperity of the
kingdom. They had held secret conversations with
certain men notorious for their audacity, and had poured
into the hearts of these wretches the poison which they
had first prepared in their own.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_159" id="Ref_159" href="#Foot_159">[159]</a></span>
Could we permit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
their crime, spreading wider and wider, to give a death-blow
to the State? Fisher and More alone opposed
laws which had been accepted by the general consent
of the people, and were necessary to the prosperity of
the kingdom. Our <i>mildest</i> of sovereigns could not longer
tolerate an offence so atrocious.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_160" id="Ref_160" href="#Foot_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Even these excuses accuse and condemn Henry. Neither
More nor Fisher had entered into a plot against
the State; their resistance had been purely religious;
they were free to act according to their consciences. It
might have been necessary to take some prudential
measures in an age as yet little fitted for liberty; but
nothing could excuse the scaffold, erected by the king's
orders, for men who were regarded with universal
respect.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">VISITATION OF THE MONASTERIES: THEIR SCANDALS AND SUPPRESSION.<br />
 (<span class="smc">September 1535 to 1536.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> death of the late tutor and friend of the prince
was to be followed by a measure less cruel but far more
general. The pope who treated kings so rudely should
not be surprised if kings treated the monks severely.
Henry knew—had indeed been a close witness of their
lazy and often irregular lives. One day, when he was
hunting in the forest of Windsor, he lost his way, perhaps
intentionally, and about the dinner hour knocked
at the gate of Reading Abbey. As he represented himself
to be one of his Majesty's guards, the abbot said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
'You will dine with me;' and the king sat down to a
table covered with abundant and delicate dishes. After
examining everything carefully: 'I will stick to this
sirloin,' said he, pointing to a piece of beef of which he
eat heartily.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_161" id="Ref_161" href="#Foot_161">[161]</a></span>
The abbot looked on with admiration. 'I
would give a hundred pounds,' he exclaimed, 'to eat
with as much appetite as you; but alas! my weak and
qualmish stomach can hardly digest the wing of a
chicken.'—'I know how to bring back your appetite,'
thought the king. A few days later some soldiers
appeared at the convent, took away the abbot, and shut
him up in the Tower, where he was put upon bread and
water. 'What have I done,' he kept asking, 'to incur
his Majesty's displeasure to such a degree?' After a
few weeks, Henry went to the state prison, and concealing
himself in an ante-room whence he could see the
abbot, ordered a sirloin of beef to be set before him.
The famished monk in his turn fell upon the joint, and
(according to tradition) eat it all. The king now
showed himself: 'Sir abbot,' he said, 'I have cured you
of your qualms; now pay me my wages. It is a hundred
pounds, you know.' The abbot paid and returned to
Reading; but Henry never after forgot the monks'
kitchen.</p>

<p class="side">=STATE OF THE MONASTERIES.=</p>

<p>The state of the monasteries was an occasion of scandal:
for many centuries all religious life had died out
in most of those establishments. The monks lived,
generally, in idleness, gluttony, and licentiousness, and
the convents which should have been houses of saints
had become in many cases mere sties of lazy gormandizers
and impure sensualists. 'The only law they
recognize,' said Luther, speaking of these cloisters, 'is
that of the seven deadly sins.' History encounters here
a twofold danger: one is that of keeping back what is
essential, the scandalous facts that justify the suppression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
of monasteries; the other is that of saying things
that cannot be named. We must strive to steer
between these two quicksands.</p>

<p>All classes of society had become disgusted with the
monasteries: the common people would say to the
monks: 'We labor painfully, while you lead easy and
comfortable lives.' The nobility regarded them with
looks of envy and irony which threatened their wealth.
The lawyers considered them as parasitical plants, which
drew away from others the nutriment they required.
These things made the religious orders cry out with
alarm: 'If we no longer have the pope to protect us, it
is all over with us and our monasteries.' And they set
to work to prevent Henry from separating from the
pope: they circulated anonymous stories, seditious
songs, trivial lampoons, frightful prophecies and biting
satires against the king, Anne Boleyn, and the friends
of the Reformation. They held mysterious interviews
with the discontented, and took advantage of the confessional
to alarm the weak-minded. 'The supremacy
of the pope,' they said, 'is a fundamental article of the
faith: none who reject it can be saved.' People began
to fear a general revolt.</p>

<p>When Luther was informed that Henry VIII. had
abolished the authority of the pope in his kingdom, but
had suffered the religious orders to remain, he smiled at
the blunder: 'The king of England,' he said, 'weakens
the body of the papacy but at the same time strengthens
the soul.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_162" id="Ref_162" href="#Foot_162">[162]</a></span>
That could not endure for long.</p>

<p class="side">=CROMWELL'S ADVICE.=</p>

<p>Cromwell had now attained high honors and was to
mount higher still. He thought with Luther that the
pope and the monks could not exist or fall one without
the other. After having abolished the Roman pontiff, it
became necessary to abolish the monasteries. It was he
who had prevailed on the king to take the place of head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
of the Church; and now he wished him to be so really.
'Sire,' he said to Henry, 'cleanse the Lord's field from
all the weeds that stifle the good corn, and scatter everywhere
the seeds of virtue.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_163" id="Ref_163" href="#Foot_163">[163]</a></span>
In 1525, 1528, 1531 and
1534 the popes themselves lent you their help in the
suppression of monasteries; now you no longer require
their aid. Do not hesitate, Sire: the most fanatical
enemies of your supreme authority are to be found in
the convents. There is buried the wealth necessary to
the prosperity of the nation. The revenues of the religious
orders are far greater than those of all the nobility
of England. The cloister schools have fallen into decay,
and the wants of the age require better ones. To suppress
the pope and to keep the monks is like deposing
the general and delivering the fortresses of the country
up to his army. Sire, imitate the example of the
protestants and suppress the monasteries.'</p>

<p>Such language alarmed the friends of the papacy, who
stoutly opposed a scheme which they believed to be
sacrilegious. 'These foundations were consecrated to
Almighty God,' they told the king; 'respect therefore
those retreats where pious souls live in contemplation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_164" id="Ref_164" href="#Foot_164">[164]</a></span>
'Contemplation!' said Sir Henry Colt smiling; 'tomorrow,
Sire, I undertake to produce proofs of the kind
of contemplation in which these monks indulge.' Whereupon,
says an historian, Colt, knowing that a certain
number of the monks of Waltham Abbey had a fondness
for the conversation of ladies, and used to pass the
night with the nuns of Chesham Convent, went to a
narrow path through which the monks would have to
pass on their return, and stretched across it one of the
stout nets used in stag-hunting. Towards daybreak, as
the monks, lantern in hand, were making their way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
through the wood, they suddenly heard a loud noise
behind them—it was caused by men whom Colt had
stationed for the purpose—and instantly blowing out
their lights they were hurrying away, when they fell
into the toils prepared for them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_165" id="Ref_165" href="#Foot_165">[165]</a></span>
The next morning, he
presented them to the king, who laughed heartily at
their piteous looks. 'I have often seen better game,' he
said, 'but never fatter. Certainly,' he added, 'I can
make a better use of the money which the monks waste
in their debaucheries. The coast of England requires
to be fortified, my fleet and army to be increased, and
harbors to be built for the commerce which is extending
every day.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_166" id="Ref_166" href="#Foot_166">[166]</a></span>
All that is well worth the trouble of suppressing
houses of impurity.'</p>

<p>The protectors of the religious orders were not discouraged,
and maintained that it was not necessary to
shut all the convents, because of a few guilty houses.</p>

<p class="side">=REVIVING INFLUENCE OF THE LAITY.=</p>

<p>Dr. Leighton, a former officer of Wolsey's, proposed a
middle course: 'Let the king order a general visitation
of monasteries,' he said, 'and in this way he will learn
whether he ought to secularize them or not. Perhaps
the mere fear of this inspection will incline the monks
to yield to his Majesty's desires.' Henry charged
Cromwell with the execution of this measure, and for
that purpose named him vicegerent and vicar-general,
conferring on him all the ecclesiastical authority which
belonged to the king.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_167" id="Ref_167" href="#Foot_167">[167]</a></span>
'You will visit all the churches,'
he said, 'even the metropolitan, whether the see be
vacant or not; all the monasteries both of men and
women; and you will correct and punish whoever may
be found guilty.' Henry gave to his vicar precedence
over all the peers, and decided that the layman should
preside over the assembly of the clergy instead of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
primate; overlook the administration not only of the
bishops but also of the archbishops; confirm or annul
the election of prelates, deprive or suspend them, and
assemble synods. This was at the beginning of September
1535. The influence of the laity thus re-entered the
Church, but not through the proper door. They came
forward in the name of the king and his proclamations,
whilst they ought to have appeared in the name of
Christ and of His Word. The king informed the primate,
and through him all the bishops and archdeacons,
that as the general visitation was about to commence,
they should no longer exercise their jurisdiction.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_168" id="Ref_168" href="#Foot_168">[168]</a></span>
The
astonished prelates made representations, but they were
unavailing: they and their sees were to be inspected by
laymen. Although the commission of the latter did not
contain the required conditions, namely the delegation
of the flocks, this act was a pretty evident sign that the
restoration of the members of the Church to their functions
was at that time foreseen and perhaps even
regarded by many as one of the most essential parts of
the Reformation of England.</p>

<p>The monks began to tremble. Faith in the convents
no longer existed—not even in the convents themselves.
Confidence in monastic practices, relics, and pilgrimages
had grown weaker; the timbers of the monasteries were
worm-eaten, their walls were just ready to fall, and the
edifice of the Middle Ages, tottering on its foundations,
was unable to withstand the hearty blows dealt against
it. When an antiquary explores some ancient sepulchre,
he comes upon a skeleton, apparently well preserved,
but crumbling into dust at the slightest touch of the
finger; in like manner the puissant hand of the sixteenth
century had only to touch most of these monastic
institutions to reduce them to powder. The real dissolver
of the religious orders was neither Henry VIII.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
nor Cromwell: it was the devouring worm which, for
years and centuries, they had carried in their bosom.</p>

<p>The vicar-general appointed his commissioners<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_169" id="Ref_169" href="#Foot_169">[169]</a></span>
and
then assembled them as a commander-in-chief calls his
generals together. In the front rank was Dr. Leighton,
his old comrade in Wolsey's household, a skilful man
who knew the ground well and did not forget his own
interests. After him came Dr. Loudon, a man of unparalleled
activity, but without character and a weathercock
turning to every wind. With him was Sir Richard
Cromwell, nephew of the vicar-general, an upright man,
though desirous of making his way through his uncle's
influence. He was the ancestor of another Cromwell,
far more celebrated than Henry VIII.'s vicegerent.
Other two were Thomas Legh and John Apprice, the
most daring of the colleagues of the king's ministers;
besides other individuals of well known ability. The
vicegerent handed to them the instructions for their
guidance, the questions they were to put to the monks,
and the injunctions they were to impose on the abbots
and priors; after which they separated on their mission.</p>

<p>The Universities, which sadly needed a reform, were
not overlooked by Henry and his representative. Since
the time when Garret, the priest of a London parish,
circulated the New Testament at Oxford, the sacred
volume had been banished from that city, as well as the
<i>Beggar's Petition</i> and other evangelical writings. Slumber
had followed the awakening. The members of the
university, especially certain ecclesiastics who, forsaking
their parishes, had come and settled at Oxford, to enjoy
the delights of Capua,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_170" id="Ref_170" href="#Foot_170">[170]</a></span>
passed their lives in idleness and
sensuality. The royal commissioners aroused them
from this torpor. They dethroned Duns Scotus, 'the
subtle doctor,' who had reigned there for three hundred
years, and the leaves of his books were scattered to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
winds. Scholasticism fell; new lectures were established;
philosophical teaching, the natural sciences,
Latin, Greek, and divinity were extended and developed.
The students were forbidden to haunt taverns, and the
priests who had come to Oxford to enjoy life, were sent
back to their parishes.</p>

<p class="side">=CRANMER DENOUNCES ROME.=</p>

<p>The visitation of the monasteries began with those of
Canterbury, the primatial church of England. In October
1535, shortly after Michaelmas, Dr. Leighton, the
visitor, entered the cathedral, and Archbishop Cranmer
went up into the pulpit. He had seen Rome: he had
an intimate conviction that that city exerted a mischievous
influence over all Christendom; he desired, as
primate, to take advantage of this important opportunity
to break publicly with her. 'No,' he said, 'the
bishop of Rome is not God's vicar. In vain you will
tell me that the See of Rome is called <i>Sancta Sedes</i>, and
its bishop entitled <i>Sanctissimus Papa</i>: the pope's
holiness is but a holiness in name.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_171" id="Ref_171" href="#Foot_171">[171]</a></span>
Vain-glory, worldly
pomp, unrestrained lust, and vices innumerable prevail
in Rome. I have seen it with my own eyes. The pope
claims by his ceremonies to forgive men their sins: it
is a serious error. One work only blots them out,
namely, the death of our Lord Jesus Christ. So long as
the See of Rome endures, there will be no remedy for
the evils which overwhelm us. These many years I had
daily prayed unto God that I might see the power of
Rome destroyed.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_172" id="Ref_172" href="#Foot_172">[172]</a></span>
Language so frank necessarily
displeased the adherents of the pope, and accordingly,
when Cranmer alluded to his energetic daily prayer, the
Superior of the Dominicans, trembling with excitement,
exclaimed: 'What a want of charity!'</p>

<p>He was not the only person struck with indignation
and fear. As soon as the sermon was over, the Dominicans
assembled to prevent the archbishop from
carrying out his intentions. 'We must support the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
papacy,' they said, 'but do it prudently.' The prior
was selected, as being the most eloquent of the brothers,
to reply to Cranmer. Going into the pulpit, he said:
'The Church of Christ has never erred. The laws which
it makes are equal in authority to the laws of God
Himself. I do not know a single bishop of Rome who
can be reproached with vice.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_173" id="Ref_173" href="#Foot_173">[173]</a></span>
Evidently the prior,
however eloquent he might be, was not learned in the
history of the Church.</p>

<p class="side">=MONKISH DEPRAVITIES.=</p>

<p>The visitation of the Canterbury monasteries began.
The immorality of most of these houses was manifested
by scandalous scenes, and gave rise to questions which
we are forced to suppress. The abominable vices that
prevailed in them are mentioned by St. Paul in his
description of the pagan corruptions.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_174" id="Ref_174" href="#Foot_174">[174]</a></span>
The commissioners
having taken their seats in one of the halls of the
Augustine monastery, all the monks came before them,
some embarrassed, others bold, but most of them careless.
Strange questions were then put to men who declared
themselves consecrated to a devout and contemplative
life: 'Are there any among you,' asked the
commissioners, 'who disguising themselves, leave the
convent and go vagabondizing about? Do you observe
the vow of chastity, and has any one been convicted of
incontinence? Do women enter the monastery,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_175" id="Ref_175" href="#Foot_175">[175]</a></span>
or live
in it habitually?' We omit the questions that followed.
The result was scandalous: eight of the brothers were
convicted of abominable vices. The black sheep having
been set apart for punishment, Leighton called the
other monks together, and said to them: 'True religion
does not consist in shaving the head, silence, fasting,
and other observances; but in uprightness of soul,
purity of life, sincere faith in Christ, brotherly love, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
the worship of God in spirit and in truth. Do not rest
content with ceremonies, but rise to sublimer things,
and be converted from all these outward practices to
inward and deep considerations.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_176" id="Ref_176" href="#Foot_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>One visitation still more distressing followed this.
The Carthusian monastery at Canterbury, four monks of
which had died piously, contained several rotten members.
Some of them used to put on lay dresses, and
leave the convent during the night. There was one
house for monks and another for nuns, and the blacksmith
of the monastery confessed that a monk had asked
him to file away a bar of the window which separated
the two cloisters. It was the duty of the monks to confess
the nuns; but by one of those refinements of corruption
which mark the lowest degree of vice, the sin
and absolution often followed close upon each other.
Some nuns begged the visitors not to permit certain
monks to enter their house again.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_177" id="Ref_177" href="#Foot_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>The visitation being continued through Kent, the visitors
came on the 22nd of October to Langdon Abbey,
near Dover. William Dyck, abbot of the monastery of
the Holy Virgin, possessed a very bad reputation.
Leighton, who was determined to surprise him, ordered
his attendants to surround the abbey in such a manner
that no one could leave it. He then went to the abbot's
house, which looked upon the fields, and was full of
doors and windows by which any one could escape.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_178" id="Ref_178" href="#Foot_178">[178]</a></span>
Leighton began to knock loudly, but no one answered.
Observing an axe, he took it up, dashed in the door with
it, and entered. He found a woman with the monk,
and the visitors discovered in a chest the men's clothes
which she put on when she wished to pass for one of the
younger brethren. She escaped, but one of Cromwell's
servants caught her and took her before the mayor at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
Dover, where she was placed in the cage. As for the
holy father abbot, says Leighton, he was put in prison.
A few of the monks signed an act by which they declared
that their house being threatened with utter ruin,
temporal and spiritual, the king alone could find a
remedy, and they consequently surrendered it to his
Majesty.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_179" id="Ref_179" href="#Foot_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The abbot of Fountains had ruined his abbey by
publicly keeping six women. One night he took away
the golden crosses and jewels belonging to the monastery,
and sold them to a jeweller for a small sum.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_180" id="Ref_180" href="#Foot_180">[180]</a></span>
At Mayden-Bradley, Leighton found another father
prior, one Richard, who had five women, six sons, and
a daughter pensioned on the property of the convent:
his sons, tall, stout young men, lived with him and
waited on him. Seeing that the Roman Church prohibited
the clergy from obeying the commandment of
Scripture, which says: <i>A bishop must be the husband of
one wife</i>, these wretched men took five or six. The
impositions of the monks to extort money injured them
in public opinion far more then their debauchery.
Leighton found in St. Anthony's convent at Bristol a
tunic of our Lord, a petticoat of the Virgin, a part of
the Last Supper, and a fragment of the stone upon
which Jesus was born at Bethlehem.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_181" id="Ref_181" href="#Foot_181">[181]</a></span>
All these brought
in money.</p>

<p>Every religious and moral sentiment is disgusted at
hearing of the disorders and frauds of the monks, and
yet the truth of history requires that they should be
made known. Here is one of the means—of the blasphemous
means—they employed to deceive the people.
At Hales in Gloucestershire, the monks pretended that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
they had preserved some of Christ's blood in a bottle.
The man whose deadly sins God had not yet pardoned
could not see it, they said; while the absolved sinner
saw it instantaneously. Thousands of penitents crowded
thither from all parts. If a rich man confessed to the
priest and laid his gift on the altar, he was conducted
into the mysterious chapel, where the precious vessel
stood in a magnificent case. The penitent knelt down
and looked, but saw nothing. 'Your sin is not yet forgiven,'
said the priest. Then came another confession,
another offering, another introduction into the sanctuary;
but the unfortunate man opened his eyes in vain,
he could see nothing until his contribution satisfied the
monks. The commissioners having sent for the vessel,
found it to be a 'crystall very thick on one side and very
transparent on the other.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_182" id="Ref_182" href="#Foot_182">[182]</a></span>
'You see, my lords,' said a
candid friar, 'when a rich penitent appears, we turn the
vessel on the thick side; that, you know, opens his
heart and his purse.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_183" id="Ref_183" href="#Foot_183">[183]</a></span>
The transparent side did not
appear until he had placed a large donation on the altar.</p>

<p class="side">=THE FRAUD AT BOXLEY.=</p>

<p>No discovery produced a greater sensation in England
than that of the practices employed at Boxley in
Kent. It possessed a famous crucifix, the image on
which, carved in wood, gave an affirmative nod with
the head, if the offering was accepted, winked the eyes
and bent the body. If the offering was too small, the
indignant figure turned away its head and made a sign
of disapproval.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_184" id="Ref_184" href="#Foot_184">[184]</a></span>
One of the Commissioners took down
the crucifix from the wall, and discovered the pipes
which carried the wires that the priestly conjuror was
wont to pull.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_185" id="Ref_185" href="#Foot_185">[185]</a></span>
Having put the machine in motion, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
said: 'You see what little account the monks have
made of us and our forefathers.' The friars trembled
with shame and alarm, while the spectators, says the
record, roared with laughter, like Ajax.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_186" id="Ref_186" href="#Foot_186">[186]</a></span>
The king
sent for the machine, and had it worked in the presence
of the court. The figure rolled its eyes, opened its
mouth, turned up its nose, let its head fall, and bent its
back. 'Upon my word,' said the king, 'I do not know
whether I ought not to weep rather than laugh, on seeing
how the poor people of England have been fooled
for so many centuries.'</p>

<p>These vile tricks were the least of the sins of those
wretches. In several convents the visitors found implements
for coining base money.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_187" id="Ref_187" href="#Foot_187">[187]</a></span>
In others they
discovered traces of the horrible cruelties practised by
the monks of one faction against those of another. Descending
into the gloomy dungeons, they perceived, by
the help of their torches, the bones of a great number
of wretched people, some of whom had died of hunger
and others had been crucified.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_188" id="Ref_188" href="#Foot_188">[188]</a></span>
But debauchery was
the most frequent case. Those pretended priests of a
God who has said: <i>Be ye holy, for I the Lord am holy</i>,
covered themselves with the hypocritical mantle of their
priesthood, and indulged in infamous impurities. They
discovered one monk, who, turning auricular confession
to an abominable purpose, had carried adultery into two
or three hundred families. The list was exhibited, and
some of the Commissioners, to their great astonishment,
says a contemporary writer, found the names of their
own wives upon it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_189" id="Ref_189" href="#Foot_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>There were sometimes riots, sieges, and battles. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
Royal Commissioners arrived at Norton Abbey in
Cheshire, the abbots of which were notorious for having
carried on a scandalous traffic with the convent plate.
On the last day of their visit, the abbot sent out his
monks to muster his supporters, and collected a band
of two or three hundred men, who surrounded the
monastery, to prevent the commissioners from carrying
anything away. The latter took refuge in a tower, which
they barricaded. It was two hours past midnight: the
abbot had ordered an ox to be killed to feed his rabble,
seated round the fires in front of the convent, and even
in the courtyard. On a sudden Sir Piers Dulton, a
justice of the peace, arrived, and fell with his posse
upon the monks and their defenders. The besiegers
were struck with terror, and ran off as fast as they could,
hiding themselves in the fish-ponds and out-houses.
The abbot and three canons, the instigators of the riot,
were imprisoned in Halton Castle.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_190" id="Ref_190" href="#Foot_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately, the king's Commissioners met with convents
of another character. When George Gifford was
visiting the monasteries of Lincolnshire, he came to a
lonely district, abounding in water but very poor,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_191" id="Ref_191" href="#Foot_191">[191]</a></span>
where
the abbey of Woolstrop was situated. The inhabitants
of the neighborhood, notwithstanding their destitution,
praised the charity of the recluses. Entering the convent,
Gifford found an honest prior and some pious
monks, who copied books, made their own clothes, and
practised the arts of embroidering, carving, painting,
and engraving. The visitor petitioned the king for the
preservation of this monastery.</p>

<p class="side">=THE NUNNERIES.=</p>

<p>The Commissioners had particular instructions for
the women's convents. 'Is your house perfectly closed?'
they asked the abbess and the nuns. 'Can a man get
into it?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_192" id="Ref_192" href="#Foot_192">[192]</a></span>
Are you in the habit of writing love-letters?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_193" id="Ref_193" href="#Foot_193">[193]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
At Litchfield the nuns declared that there was no
disorder in the convent; but one good old woman told
everything, and when Leighton reproached the prioress
for her falsehood, she replied: 'Our religion compels
us to it. At our admission we swore never to reveal the
secret sins that were committed among us.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_194" id="Ref_194" href="#Foot_194">[194]</a></span>
There
were some houses in which nearly all the nuns trampled
under foot the most sacred duties of their sex, and were
without mercy for the unhappy fruits of their disorders.</p>

<p>Such were frequently in those times the monastic
orders of the West. The eloquent apologists who
eulogize their virtues without distinction, and the exaggerating
critics who pronounce the same sentence of
condemnation against all, are both mistaken. We have
rendered homage to the monks who were upright; we
may blame those who were guilty. The scandals, let
us say, did not proceed from the founders of these orders.
Sentiments, opposed beyond a doubt to the principles
of the Gospel, although they were well-intentioned, had
presided over the formation of the monasteries. The
hermits Paul, Anthony, and others of the third and
fourth centuries gave themselves up to an anti-Evangelical
asceticism, but still they struggled courageously
against temptation. However, one must be very ignorant
not to see that corruption must eventually issue
from monastic institutions. <i>Every plant which my
heavenly Father hath not planted shall be rooted up</i>, is the
language of the Gospel.</p>

<p>We do not exaggerate. The monasteries were sometimes
an asylum in which men and women, whose hearts
had been wrecked in the tempests of life, sought a repose
which the world did not offer. They were mistaken;
they ought to have lived with God, but in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
midst of society. And yet there is a pleasure in believing
that behind those walls, which hid so much
corruption, there were some elect souls who loved God.
Such were found at Catesby, at Godstow, near Oxford,
and in other places. The Visitors asked for the preservation
of these houses.</p>

<p>If the visitation of the convents was a bitter draught
to many of the inmates, it was a cup of joy to the greater
number. Many monks and nuns had been put into
the convents during their infancy, and were detained in
them against their will. No one ought to be forced, according
to Cromwell's principles. When the visitation
took place, the Visitors announced to every monk under
twenty-four years of age, and to every nun under twenty-one,
that they might leave the convent. Almost all to
whom the doors were thus opened, hastened to profit
by it. A secular dress was given them, with some
money, and they departed with pleasure. But great was
the sorrow among many whose age exceeded the limit.
Falling on their knees, they entreated the Commissioners
to obtain a similar favor for them. 'The life we lead
here,' they said, 'is contrary to our conscience.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_195" id="Ref_195" href="#Foot_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERS.=</p>

<p>The Commissioners returned to London, and made
their report to the Council. They were distressed and
disgusted. 'We have discovered,' they said, 'not seven,
but more than seven hundred thousand deadly sins.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_196" id="Ref_196" href="#Foot_196">[196]</a></span>
...
These abominable monks are the <i>ravening wolves</i>
whose coming Christ has announced, and who under
sheep's clothing devour the flock. Here are the confessions
of the monks and nuns, subscribed with their own
hands.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_197" id="Ref_197" href="#Foot_197">[197]</a></span>
This book may well be called <i>The Book of
God's Judgment</i>. The monasteries are so full of iniquity
that they ought to fall down under such a weight. If
there be here and there any innocent cloister, they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
so few in number that they cannot save the others.
Our hearts melt and all our limbs tremble at the thought
of the abominations we have witnessed. O Lord! what
wilt Thou answer to the five cities which Thou didst
consume by fire, when they remind Thee of the iniquities
of those monks, whom Thou hast so long supported?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_198" id="Ref_198" href="#Foot_198">[198]</a></span>
The eloquence of Ptolemy, the memory of Pliny, and
the pen of St. Augustine would not be able to give us
the detestable history of these abominations.'</p>

<p class="side">=DELIBERATIONS OF THE COUNCIL.=</p>

<p>The Council began to deliberate, and many of the
members called for the secularization of a part of the
monasteries. The partisans of the religious orders took
up their defence, and acknowledged that there was
room for reform. 'But,' they added, 'will you deprive
of all asylum the pious souls who desire to quit the
world, and lead a devout life to the glory of their
Maker?' They tried even to invalidate in some points
the testimony of the Visitors; but the latter declared
that, far from having recorded lightly those scandalous
facts, they had excluded many.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_199" id="Ref_199" href="#Foot_199">[199]</a></span>
'We have not reported
certain public scandals,' they said, 'because they seem
opposed to the famous charter of the monks—<i>Si non
caste, tamen caute</i>.' Men of influence supported the
Commissioners' conclusions; a few members of the
Council were inclined to indulgence; even Cromwell
seemed disposed to attempt the reform of whatever was
susceptible of improvement; but many believed that all
amendment was impossible. 'We must, above all things,
diminish the wealth of the clergy,' said Dr. Cox; 'for so
long as they do not imitate the poverty of Christ, the
people will not follow their teaching. I have no doubt,'
he added, with a touch of irony, 'that the bishops,
priests, and monks will readily free themselves from the
heavy burden of wealth of every kind, which renders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
the fulfilment of their spiritual duties impossible.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_200" id="Ref_200" href="#Foot_200">[200]</a></span>
Other reasons were alleged. 'The income of the monasteries,'
said one of the privy-councillors, 'amounts to
500,000 ducats, while that of all the nobility of England
is only 380,000.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_201" id="Ref_201" href="#Foot_201">[201]</a></span>
This disproportion is intolerable,
and must be put an end to. For the welfare of his subjects
and of the Church, the King should increase the
number of bishoprics, parishes, and hospitals. He must
augment the forces of the State, and prepare to resist
the Emperor, whose fleets and armies threaten us. Shall
we ask the people for taxes, who have already so much
trouble to get a living, while the monks continue to consume
their wealth in laziness and debauchery? It
would be monstrous injustice. The treasures which
the convents derive from the nation ought no longer to
be useless to the nation.'</p>

<p>In February 1536, this serious matter was laid before
Parliament. It was Thomas Cromwell whose heavy
hand struck these receptables of impurity, and whom
men called 'the hammer of the monks,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_202" id="Ref_202" href="#Foot_202">[202]</a></span>
who proposed
this great reform. He laid on the table of the Commons
that famous <i>Black Book</i>, in which were inscribed
the misdeeds of the religious orders, and desired that
it should be read to the House. The book is no longer
in existence: it was destroyed, in the reign of Queen
Mary, by those who had an interest in its suppression.
But it was then opened before the Parliament of England.
There had never before been such a reading in
any assembly. The facts were clearly recorded—the
most detestable enormities were not veiled: the horrible
confessions of the monks, signed with their own hands
were exhibited to the members of the Commons. The
recital produced an extraordinary effect. Men had had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
no idea of such abominable scandals.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_203" id="Ref_203" href="#Foot_203">[203]</a></span>
The House was
horror-stricken, and 'Down with them—down with
them!' was shouted on every side.</p>

<p>The debate commenced. Personally, the members
were generally interested in the preservation of the monasteries:
most of them had some connection with one
cloister or another; priors and other heads had relations
and friends in Parliament. Nevertheless the condemnation
was general, and men spoke of those monkish
sanctuaries as, in former times, men had spoken of the
priests of Jezebel—'Let us pull down their houses, and
overturn their altars.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_204" id="Ref_204" href="#Foot_204">[204]</a></span>
There were, however, some
objections. Twenty-six abbots, heads of the great monasteries,
sat as barons in the Upper House: these were
respected. Besides, the great convents were less disorderly
than the small ones. Cromwell restricted himself
for the moment to the secularization of 376 cloisters, in
each of which there were fewer than twelve persons.
The abbots, flattered by the exception made in their
favor, were silent, and even the bishops hardly cared to
defend institutions which had long been withdrawn from
their authority. 'These monasteries,' said Cromwell,
'being the dishonor of religion, and all the attempts, repeated
through more than two centuries, having shown
that their reformation is impossible, the King, as supreme
head of the Church under God, proposes to the
Lords and Commons, and these agree, that the possessions
of the said houses, shall cease to be wasted for the
maintenance of sin, and shall be converted to better
uses.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_205" id="Ref_205" href="#Foot_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=REAL RELIGIOUS HOUSES.=</p>

<p>There was immediately a great commotion throughout
England. Some rejoiced, while others wept: superstition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
became active, and weak minds believed everything
that was told them. 'The Virgin,' they were
assured, 'had appeared to certain monks, and ordered
them to serve her as they had hitherto done.' 'What!
no more religious houses,' exclaimed others, through
their tears.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_206" id="Ref_206" href="#Foot_206">[206]</a></span>
'On the contrary,' said Latimer; 'look
at that man and woman living together piously, tranquilly,
in the fear of God, keeping His Word and active
in the duties of their calling: they form <i>a religious house</i>,
one that is truly acceptable to God. Pure religion consists
not in wearing a hood, but in visiting the fatherless
and the widows, and keeping ourselves unspotted from
the world. What has hitherto been called a religious
life was an irreligious life.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_207" id="Ref_207" href="#Foot_207">[207]</a></span>
'And yet,' said the devout,
'the monks had more holiness than those who live
in the world.' Latimer again went into the pulpit and
said: 'When St. Anthony, the father of monkery, lived
in the desert, and thought himself the most holy of men,
he asked God who should be his companion in heaven,
if it were possible for him to have one. "Go to Alexandria,"
said the Lord; "in such a street and house you
will find him."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_208" id="Ref_208" href="#Foot_208">[208]</a></span>
Anthony left the desert, sought the
house, and found a poor cobbler in a wretched shop
mending old shoes. The saint took up his abode with
him, that he might learn by what mortifications the cobbler
had made himself worthy of such great celestial
honor. Every morning the poor man knelt down in
prayer with his wife, and then went to work. When
the dinner-hour arrived, he sat down at a table on which
were bread and cheese; he gave thanks, ate his meal
with joy, brought up his children in the fear of God,
and faithfully discharged all his duties. At this sight,
St. Anthony looked inwards, became contrite of heart,
and put away his pride. Such is the new sort of <i>religious houses</i>,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
added Latimer, 'that we desire to have now.'</p>

<p>And yet, strange to say, Latimer was almost the only
person among the Evangelicals who raised his voice in
favor of the religious bodies. He feared that if the
property of the convents passed into the greedy hands
of Henry's courtiers, the tenants, accustomed to the
mild treatment of the abbots, would be oppressed by
the lay landlords, desirous of realizing the fruits of
their estate unto the very last drop. The Bishop of
Worcester, being somewhat enthusiastic, was anxious
that a few convents should be preserved as houses of
study, prayer, hospitality, charity, and preaching.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_209" id="Ref_209" href="#Foot_209">[209]</a></span>
Cranmer, who had more discernment and a more practical
spirit, had no hope of the monks. 'Satan,' he said,
'lives in the monasteries; he is satisfied and at his
ease, like a gentleman in his inn, and the monks and
nuns are his very humble servants.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_210" id="Ref_210" href="#Foot_210">[210]</a></span>
The primate,
however, took little part in this great measure.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_211" id="Ref_211" href="#Foot_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=SUPPRESSION OF THE MONASTERIES.=</p>

<p>The Bill for the suppression of the monasteries passed
the two Houses on the 4th of February, 1536. It gave
to the king and his heirs all the convents whose annual
income did not exceed £200 sterling. About ten thousand
monks and nuns were secularized. This Act
added to the revenue of the Crown a yearly rental of
£32,000 sterling, besides the immediate receipt of
£100,000 sterling in silver, jewels, and other articles.
The possessions hitherto employed by a few to gratify
their carnal appetites seemed destined to contribute to
the prosperity of the whole nation.</p>

<p>Unhappily, the shameless cupidity of the monks was
replaced by a cupidity of a different nature. Petitions
poured in to Cromwell from every quarter. The saying
of Scripture was fulfilled, <i>Wheresoever the carcass is, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
will the eagles be gathered together</i>. Thomas Cobham,
brother of Lord Cobham, represented that the Grey
Friars' monastery at Canterbury was in a convenient
position for him; that it was the city where he was born,
and where all his friends lived. He consequently asked
that it should be given him, and Cranmer, whose niece
he had married, supported the prayer.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_212" id="Ref_212" href="#Foot_212">[212]</a></span>
'My good
Lord,' said Lord-Chancellor Audley, 'my only salary is
that of the chancellorship; give me a few good convents;
I will give you my friendship during my life,
and twenty pounds sterling for your trouble.' 'My
specially dear Lord,' said Sir Thomas Eliot, 'I have
been the king's ambassador at Rome; my services deserve
some recompense. Pray his Majesty to grant
me some of the suppressed convent lands. I will give
your lordship the income of the first year.'</p>

<p>History has to record evils of another nature. Some
of the finest libraries in England were destroyed, and
works of great value sold for a trifle to the grocers.
Friends of learning on the continent bought many of
them, and carried away whole shiploads. One man
changed his religion for the sake of a piece of abbey
land. The king lost at play the treasures of which he
had stripped the monastic orders, and used convents as
stables for his horses. Some persons had imagined
that the suppression of the monasteries would lead to
the abolition of taxes and subsidies; but it was not so,
and the nation found itself burdened with a poor-law
in addition to the ordinary taxes.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_213" id="Ref_213" href="#Foot_213">[213]</a></span>
There were, however,
more worthy cases than those of the king and his
courtiers. 'Most dread, mighty, and noble prince,'
wrote the lord-mayor of London to the king, 'give
orders that the three city hospitals shall henceforward
subserve not the pleasures of those canons, priests, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
monks, whose dirty and disgusting bodies encumber
our streets; but be used for the comfort of the sick and
blind, the aged and crippled.'</p>

<p>The Act of Parliament was immediately carried out.
The earl of Sussex, Sir John St. Clair, Anthony Fitzherbert,
Richard Cromwell, and several other commissioners,
travelled through England and made known to
the religious communities the statutory dissolution.
The voice of truth was heard from a small number of
monasteries. 'Assuredly,' said the Lincolnshire Franciscans,
'the perfection of Christian life does not consist
in wearing a gray frock, in disguising ourselves in
strange fashion, in bending the body and nodding the
head,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_214" id="Ref_214" href="#Foot_214">[214]</a></span>
and in wearing a girdle full of knots. The true
Christian life has been divinely manifested to us in
Christ; and for that reason we submit with one consent
to the king's orders.' The monks of the convent
of St. Andrew at Northampton acknowledged to the
commissioners that they had taken the habit of the
order to live in comfortable idleness and not by virtuous
labor, and had indulged in continual drunkenness, and
in carnal and voluptuous appetites.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_215" id="Ref_215" href="#Foot_215">[215]</a></span>
'We have covered
the gospel of Christ with shame,' they said. 'Now,
seeing the gulf of everlasting fire gaping to swallow us
up, and impelled by the stings of our conscience, we
humble ourselves with lowly repentance, and pray for
pardon, giving up ourselves and our convent to our
sovereign king and lord.'</p>

<p class="side">=SORROW AND DESPAIR.=</p>

<p>But they did not all use the same language. It was
the last hour for the convents. There was a ceaseless
movement in the cloisters; bursts of sorrow and fear,
of anger and despair. What! No more monasteries!
no more religious pomps! no more gossip! no more
refectory! Those halls, wherein their predecessors had
paced for centuries; those chapels, in which they had
worshipped kneeling on the pavement, were to be converted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
to vulgar uses. A few convents endeavored to
bribe Cromwell: 'If you save our house,' said the
abbot of Peterborough, 'I will give the king two million
five hundred marks, and yourself three hundred pounds
sterling.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_216" id="Ref_216" href="#Foot_216">[216]</a></span>
But Cromwell had conceived a great national
measure, and wished to carry it out. Neither the eloquence
of the monks, their prayers, their promises, nor
their money could move him.</p>

<p>Some of the abbots set themselves in open revolt
against the king, but were forced to submit at last. The
old halls, the long galleries, the narrow cells of the
convents, became emptier from day to day. The monks
received a pension in proportion to their age. Those
who desired to continue in the religious life were sent
to the large monasteries. Many were dismissed with a
few shillings for their journey and a new gown.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_217" id="Ref_217" href="#Foot_217">[217]</a></span>
'As
for you,' said the commissioners to the young monks
under twenty-five, 'you must earn a living by the work
of your hands.' The same rule was applied to the
nuns.</p>

<p>There was great suffering at this period. The inhabitants
of the cloisters were strangers in the world:
England was to them an unknown land. Monks and
nuns might be seen wandering from door to door, seeking
an asylum for the night. Many, who were young
then, grew old in beggary. Their sin had been great,
and so was their chastisement. Some of the monks fell
into a gloomy melancholy, even into frightful despair:
the remembrance of their faults pursued them; God's
judgment terrified them; the sight of their miseries infuriated
them. 'I am like Esau,' said one of them, 'I
shall be eternally damned.' And he strangled himself
with his collar. Another stabbed himself with a penknife.
Some compassionate people having deprived him
of the power of injuring himself, he exclaimed with rage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
'If I cannot die in this manner, I shall easily find
another;' and taking a piece of paper, he wrote on it:
<i>Rex tanquam tyrannus opprimit populum suum</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_218" id="Ref_218" href="#Foot_218">[218]</a></span>
This
he placed in one of the church books, where it was
found by a parishioner, who in great alarm called out
to the persons around him. The monk, full of hope
that he would be brought to trial, drew near and said,
'It was I who did it: here I am; let them put me to
death.'</p>

<p>Erelong those gloomy clouds, which seemed to announce
a day of storms, appeared to break. There were
tempests afterwards, but, speaking generally, England
found in this energetic act one of the sources of her
greatness, instead of the misfortunes with which she
was threatened. At the moment when greedy eyes began
to covet the revenues of Cambridge and Oxford, a
recollection of the pleasant days of his youth was awakened
in Henry's mind. 'I will not permit the wolves
around me,' he said, 'to fall upon the universities.'
Indeed, the incomes of a few convents were employed
in the foundation of new schools, and particularly of
Trinity College, Cambridge; and these institutions
helped to spread throughout England the lights of the
Renaissance and of the Reformation. An eloquent voice
was heard from those antique halls, saying: 'O most
invincible prince, great is the work that you have begun.
Christ had laid the foundation; the apostles raised the
building. But alas! barren weeds had overrun it; the
papal tyranny had bowed all heads beneath its yoke.
Now, you have rejected the pope; you have banished
the race of monks. What more can we ask for? We
pray that those houses of cenobites, where an ignorant
swarm of drones was wont to buzz,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_219" id="Ref_219" href="#Foot_219">[219]</a></span>
should behold in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
their academic halls a generous youth, eager to be
taught, and learned men to teach them. Let the light
which has been restored to us spread its rays through
all the universe and kindle other torches, so that the
darkness should flee all over the world<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_220" id="Ref_220" href="#Foot_220">[220]</a></span>
before the
dawn of a new day.'</p>

<p>It was not learning alone that gained by the suppression
of the monasteries. The revenues of the
crown, which were about seven hundred thousand
ducats, increased by those of the convents which were
about nine hundred thousand, were more than doubled.
This wealth, hitherto useless, served to fortify England
and Ireland, build fortresses along the coasts, repair
the harbors, and create an imposing fleet. The kingdom
took a step in the career of power. By the
reformation of the convents the moral force of the nation
gained still more than the material force. The
abolition of the papacy restored to the people that
national unity which Rome had taken away; and England,
freed from subjection to a foreign power, could
oppose her enemies with a sword of might and a front
of iron.</p>

<p class="side">=NATIONAL PROSPERITY.=</p>

<p>Political economy, rural economy, all that concerns
the collection and distribution of wealth, then took a
start that nothing has been able to check. The estates,
taken from the easy-going monks, produced riches.
The king and the nobility, desirous of deriving the
greatest gain possible from the domains that had fallen
to them, endeavored to improve agriculture. Many
men, until that time useless, electrified by the movement
of minds, sought the means of existence. The Reformation,
from which the nation expected only purity of
doctrine, helped to increase the general prosperity,
industry, commerce, and navigation. The poor remembered
that God had commanded man to eat his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
bread, not in the shade of the monasteries, but <i>in the
sweat of his brow</i>. To this epoch we must ascribe the
origin of those mercantile enterprises, of those long and
distant voyages which were to be one day the strength
of Great Britain. Henry VIII. was truly the father of
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Moral, social, and political development was no less a
gainer by the order that was established. At the first
moment, no doubt, England presented the appearance
of a vast chaos: but from that chaos there sprang a new
world. Forces which had hitherto been lost in obscure
cells, were employed for the good of society. The men
who had been dwelling carelessly within or without the
cloister walls, and had expended all their activity in listlessly
giving or listlessly receiving alms, were violently
shaken by the blows from the <i>Malleus monachorum</i>, the
hammer of the monks: they aroused themselves, and
made exertions which turned to the public good. Their
children, and especially their grandchildren, became
useful citizens. The third estate appeared. The
population of the cloisters was transformed into an
active and intelligent middle class. The very wealth,
acquired, it is true, greedily by the nobility, secured
them an independence, which enabled them to oppose
a salutary counterpoise to the pretensions of the crown.
The Upper House, where the ecclesiastical element had
predominated, became essentially a lay house by the
absence of the abbots and priors. A public grew up. A
new life animated antique institutions that had remained
almost useless. It was not, in truth, until later that
mighty England, having become decidedly evangelical
and constitutional, sat down victoriously on the two
great ruins of feudalism and popery; but an important
step was taken under Henry VIII. That great transformation
extended its influence even beyond the shores
of Great Britain. The blow aimed at the system of the
Middle Ages re-echoed throughout Europe, and everywhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
shook the artificial scaffolding. Spain and Italy
alone remained almost motionless in the midst of their
ancient darkness.</p>

<p>The suppression of the monasteries, begun in 1535,
was continued in 1538, and brought to a conclusion in
1539 by an Act of Parliament.</p>

<p class="side">=A PROPHECY.=</p>

<p>A voice was heard from these ruined convents, exclaiming:
'Praise and thanksgiving to God! <i>For other foundation
can no man lay than Jesus Christ.</i> Whoever believes
that Jesus Christ is the <i>pacifier</i> who turneth away from
our heads the strokes of God's wrath,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_221" id="Ref_221" href="#Foot_221">[221]</a></span>
lays the true
foundation; and on that firm base he shall raise a better
building than that which had the monks for its pillars!'
This prophecy of Sir William Overbury's did not fail
to be accomplished.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">Henry VIII.</span> having thrown down the <i>pillar of the
papacy</i>—the monks—felt the necessity of strengthening
the work he had begun by alliances with the continental
protestants. He did not turn to the Swiss or the French
Reformers: their small political importance, as well as
the decided character of their Reform, alienated him
from them. 'What inconsiderate men they are,' said
Calvin, 'who exalt the king of England. To ascribe
sovereign authority to the prince in everything, to call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
him supreme head of the Church under Christ, is in my
opinion blasphemy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_222" id="Ref_222" href="#Foot_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=MELANCHTHON.=</p>

<p>Henry hoped more from Germany than from Switzerland.
As early as 1534 three senators of Lubeck had
presented to him the Confession of Augsburg, and proposed
an alliance against the Roman pontiff.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_223" id="Ref_223" href="#Foot_223">[223]</a></span>
Anne
Boleyn pressed the king to unite with the protestants,
and in the spring of 1535 Barnes was sent to Wittemberg,
where he induced the Reformers to claim his master's
protection. Melanchthon, who was more inclined than
Luther to have recourse to princes, since he did not refuse
to unite with Francis I., did not reject the advances
of Henry VIII. 'Sire,' he wrote in March 1535, 'this is
now the golden age for Britain.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_224" id="Ref_224" href="#Foot_224">[224]</a></span>
In times of old, when
the armies of the Goths had stifled letters in Europe,
your island restored them to the universe. I entreat you
in the name of Jesus Christ to plead for us before kings.'
The illustrious doctor dedicated to this prince the new
edition of his <i>Common-Places</i>, and commissioned Alesius,
a Scotchman, to present it with the hope that he should
see England become the salvation of many nations, and
even of the whole Church of Christ.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_225" id="Ref_225" href="#Foot_225">[225]</a></span>
Alesius, who had
taken refuge in Saxony, was happy to return to that
island from which the fanaticism of the Scotch clergy
had compelled him flee. He was presented to the uncle
of his king, and Henry, delighted with the Scotchman,
said to him: 'I name you my scholar,' and directed
Cranmer to send Melanchthon two hundred crowns.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
They were accompanied by a letter for the illustrious
professor, in which the king signed himself: <i>Your friend
Henry</i>.</p>

<p>But it was not long before the hopes of a union
between Germany and England seemed to vanish.
Scarcely had Melanchthon vaunted in his dedication to
Henry VIII. the moderation of the king—a moderation
worthy (he had said) of a wise prince—when he heard
of the execution of Fisher and More. He shrank back
with terror. 'Morus,' he exclaimed, 'has been put to
death, and others with him.' The cruelties of the king
tortured the gentle Philip. The idea that a man of letters
like More should fall by the hands of the executioner,
scandalized him. He began to fear for his own life.
'I am myself,' he said, 'in great peril.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_226" id="Ref_226" href="#Foot_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry did not suspect the horror which his crime
would excite on the continent, and had just read with
delight a passage of Melanchthon's in which the latter
compared him to Ptolemy Philadelphus! He therefore
said to Barnes: 'Go and bring him back with you.'
Barnes returned to Wittemberg in September and delivered
his message. But the doctor of Germany had
never received so alarming an invitation before. He
imagined it to be a treacherous scheme. 'The mere
thought of the journey,' he said, 'overwhelms me with
distress.' Barnes tried to encourage him. 'The king
will give you a magnificent escort,' he said, 'and even
hostages, if you desire it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_227" id="Ref_227" href="#Foot_227">[227]</a></span>
Melanchthon, who had
More's bleeding head continually before him, was
immovable. Luther also regarded Barnes with an
unfavorable eye, and called him <i>the black Englishman</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_228" id="Ref_228" href="#Foot_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The envoy was more fortunate with the elector. John
Frederick, hearing that the king of England was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
desirous of forming an alliance with the princes of Germany,
replied that he would communicate this important
demand to them. He then entertained Barnes at a
sumptuous breakfast, made him handsome presents, and
wrote to Henry VIII. that the desire manifested by him
to reform religious doctrine augmented his love for
him, 'for,' he added, 'it belongs to kings to propagate
Christ's gospel far and wide.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_229" id="Ref_229" href="#Foot_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Luther also, but from other motives than those of the
elector, did not look so closely as Melanchthon; the
suppression of the monasteries prepossessed him in favor
of his ancient adversary. The penalties with which the
Carthusians and others had been visited did not alarm
him. Vergerio, the papal legate, who was at Wittemberg
at the beginning of November, invited Luther to
breakfast with him. 'I know,' he said, 'that king Henry
kills cardinals and bishops, but ...' and biting
his lips, he made a significant movement with his hand,
as if he wished to cut off the king's head. When relating
this anecdote to Melanchthon, who was then at Jena,
Luther added: 'Would to God that we possessed several
kings of England to put to death those bishops,
cardinals, legates, and popes who are nothing but
robbers, traitors, and devils!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_230" id="Ref_230" href="#Foot_230">[230]</a></span>
Luther was less tender
than he is represented when contrasted with Calvin.
Those hasty words expressed really the thoughts of all
parties. The spiritual leaven of the gospel had to work
for a century or more upon the hard material of which
the heart of man is made, before the errors of Romish
legislation, a thousand years old, were banished. No
doubt there was an immediate mitigation produced by
the Reformation; but if any one had told the men of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
sixteenth century that it was wrong to put men to death
for acts of impiety, they would have been as astonished,
and perhaps more so, than our judges, if they were
abused because, in conformity with the law, they visited
murder with capital punishment. It is strange, however,
that it required so many centuries to understand
those glorious words of our Saviour: <i>The Son of man is
not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_231" id="Ref_231" href="#Foot_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>The condition which the protestants placed on their
union with Henry VIII. rendered the alliance difficult.
'We only ask one thing,' said the Reformers to Barnes,
'that the doctrine which is in <i>conformity with Scripture</i>
be restored to the <i>whole world</i>;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_232" id="Ref_232" href="#Foot_232">[232]</a></span>
but Henry still observed
the catholic doctrine. But he was told that the Lutherans
and Francis I., thanks to Melanchthon's mediation, were
probably coming to an agreement, and that a general
council would be summoned. What treatment could he
expect from such an assembly, he who had so grievously
offended the papacy! Desirous of preventing a council
at any price, the king determined in September, 1535, to
send a more important embassy to the Lutherans, in
order to persuade them to renounce the idea of coming
to terms with the pope, and rather to form an alliance
with England.</p>

<p class="side">=EMBASSY TO GERMANY.=</p>

<p>Consequently Fox, bishop of Hereford, a proud and
insolent courtier, and Archdeacon Hare, an amiable and
enlightened man, with some others, started for Germany
and joined Barnes and Mount who had preceded them.
On the 24th of December they were admitted into the
presence of the Elector of Saxony, the Landgrave of
Hesse, and other protestant deputies and princes: 'The
king our master,' they said, 'has abolished the power of
the Roman bishop throughout his dominions, and rejected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
his pretended pardons and his old wives' stories.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_233" id="Ref_233" href="#Foot_233">[233]</a></span>
Accordingly the pope, in a transport of fury, has summoned
all the kings of the earth to take arms against him.
But neither pope nor papists alarm our prince. He
offers you his person, his wealth, and his sceptre to
combat the Roman power. Let us unite against it, and
the Spirit of God will bind our confederation together.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_234" id="Ref_234" href="#Foot_234">[234]</a></span>
The princes replied to this eloquent harangue, 'that if
the king engaged to propagate the pure doctrine of the
faith as it had been confessed at the diet of Augsburg;
if he engaged, like them, never to concede to the Roman
bishop any jurisdiction in his States, they would name
him Defender and Protector of their confederation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_235" id="Ref_235" href="#Foot_235">[235]</a></span>
They added that they would send a deputation, including
one man of excellent learning (meaning Melanchthon), to
confer with the king upon the changes to be made in the
Church. The Englishmen could not conceal their joy,
but the theologian had lost all confidence in Henry VIII.
'The death of More distresses me: I will have nothing
to do with the business.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_236" id="Ref_236" href="#Foot_236">[236]</a></span>
Nevertheless the treaty of
alliance was signed on the 25th December, 1535.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_237" id="Ref_237" href="#Foot_237">[237]</a></span>
The
catholic party, especially in England, was troubled at the
news, and Gardiner, then ambassador in France, lost no
time in writing to oppose designs which would establish
protestantism in the Anglican Church.</p>

<p>While the king was uniting with the Confession of
Augsburg, his relations with the most decided partisans
of the papacy were far from improving. His daughter
Mary, whose temper was melancholy and irritable, observed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
no bounds as regards her father's friends or acts,
and refused to submit to his orders. 'I bid her renounce
the title of princess,' said Henry in a passion.—'If I
consented not to be regarded as such,' she answered, 'I
should go against my conscience and incur God's displeasure.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_238" id="Ref_238" href="#Foot_238">[238]</a></span>
Henry, no friend of half-measures, talked
of putting his daughter to death, and thus frightening
the rebels. That wretched prince had a remarkable
tendency for killing those who were nearest to him. We
may see a father correct his child with a stripe; but
with this man, a blow from his hand was fatal. There
was already some talk of sending the princess to the
Tower, when the evangelical Cranmer ventured to intercede
in behalf of the catholic Mary. He reminded
Henry that he was her father, and that if he took away
her life, he would incur universal reprobation. The
king gave way to these representations, predicting to
the archbishop that this intervention would some day
cost him dear. In fact, when Mary became queen she
put to death the man who had saved her life. Henry
was content to order his daughter to be separated from
her mother. On the other hand, the terrified Catherine
endeavored to mollify the princess. 'Obey the king in
all things,' she wrote from Buckden, where she was living,
'except in those which would destroy your soul.
Speak little; trouble yourself about nothing, play on the
spinet or lute.' This unhappy woman, who had found so
much bitterness in the conjugal estate, added: 'Above
all, do not desire a husband, nor even think of it, I beg
you in the name of Christ's passion.</p>

<p>'Your loving mother, <span class="smc">Catherine the Queen</span>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_239" id="Ref_239" href="#Foot_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CATHERINE'S FIRMNESS.=</p>

<p>But the mother was not less decided than the
daughter in maintaining her rights, and would not renounce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
her title of queen, notwithstanding Henry's
orders. A commission composed of the Duke of Suffolk,
Lord Sussex, and others, arrived at Buckden to try and
induce her to do so, and all the household of the princess
was called together. The intrepid daughter of
Ferdinand and Isabella said with a firm voice: 'I am the
queen, the king's true wife.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_240" id="Ref_240" href="#Foot_240">[240]</a></span>
Being informed that it
was intended to remove her to Somersham and separate
her from some of her best friends, she answered: 'I will
not go unless you bind me with ropes.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_241" id="Ref_241" href="#Foot_241">[241]</a></span>
And to prevent
this she took to her bed and refused to dress, saying
she was ill.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_242" id="Ref_242" href="#Foot_242">[242]</a></span>
The king sent two catholic prelates, the
archbishop of York and the bishop of Durham, hoping to
soften her. 'Madam,' said the archbishop, 'your marriage
being invalid....'—'It is a lawful marriage,'
she exclaimed with passionate vehemence.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_243" id="Ref_243" href="#Foot_243">[243]</a></span>
'Until
death I shall be his Majesty's wife.'—'Members of your
own council,' continued the archbishop, 'acknowledge
that your marriage with Prince Arthur was actually consummated.'—'It
is all false!' she exclaimed in a loud
tone.—'The divorce was consequently pronounced.'...—'By
whom?' she asked.—'By my lord of Canterbury.'—'And
who is he?' returned the queen. 'A
shadow!<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_244" id="Ref_244" href="#Foot_244">[244]</a></span>
The pope has declared in my favor, and he is
Christ's vicar.'—'The king will treat you like a dear
sister,' said bishop Tonstall.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_245" id="Ref_245" href="#Foot_245">[245]</a></span>—'Nothing
in the world,'
answered Catherine, 'neither the loss of my possessions
nor the prospect of death, will make me give up my
rights.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span></p>

<p>In October, 1535, Catherine was still at Buckden.
That noble but fanatic woman increased her austerity,
indulged in the harshest practices of an ascetic life,
prayed frequently bare-kneed on the floor, while at the
same time a deadly sorrow was undermining her health.
At last consumption declared itself;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_246" id="Ref_246" href="#Foot_246">[246]</a></span>
and as her condition
required a change of air, she was removed to
Kimbolton. She longed for the society of her daughter,
which would no doubt have alleviated her sufferings;
but she asked in vain with tears to see her. Mary also
entreated the king to let her visit her mother: he was
inflexible.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_247" id="Ref_247" href="#Foot_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CHARLES ARMS AGAINST HENRY.=</p>

<p>Henry's harshness towards the aunt of Charles V.
excited the wrath of that monarch to the highest degree.
He was then returning victorious from his first African
expedition, and determined to delay no longer in carrying
out the mission he had received from the pope. To
that end it was necessary to obtain, if not the
co-operation, at least the neutrality of Francis I. That
was not easy. The king of France had always courted
the alliance of England: he had signed a treaty with
Henry against the emperor and against the pope, and
had just sought an alliance with the Lutheran princes.
But the emperor knew that the acquisition of Italy, or at
least of Lombardy, was the favorite idea of Francis I.
Charles was equally desirous of it, but he was so impatient
to re-establish Catherine of Aragon on the throne,
and bring England again under the dominion of the
pope, that he determined to sacrifice Italy, if only in
appearance. Sforza, duke of Milan, having just died
without children, the emperor offered Francis I. the
duchy of Milan for his second son, the duke of Orleans,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
if he would not oppose his designs against England.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_248" id="Ref_248" href="#Foot_248">[248]</a></span>
The king of France eagerly accepted the proposal, and
wishing to give a proof of his zeal, he even proposed
that the pope should summon all the princes of Christendom
to force the king of England to submit to the
See of Rome. The love he had for Milan went so far as
to make him propose a crusade against his natural ally,
Henry VIII.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_249" id="Ref_249" href="#Foot_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DEATH OF CATHERINE.=</p>

<p>The matter was becoming serious: rarely had a greater
danger threatened England, when an important event
suddenly removed it. At the very time when Charles V.,
aided by Francis I., desired to rouse Europe in order to
replace his aunt on the throne, she died. About the
end of December, 1535, Catherine became seriously ill,
and felt that God was bringing her great sorrows to an
end. The king, wishing to keep up appearances, sent to
inquire after her. The queen, firm to the last in her
principles, sent for her lawyers and dictated her will to
them. 'I am ready,' she said, 'to yield up my soul unto
God.... I supplicate that five hundred masses be said
for my soul; and that some personage go in pilgrimage
for me to Our Lady of Walsingham.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_250" id="Ref_250" href="#Foot_250">[250]</a></span>
I bequeath my
gowns to the convent, and the furs of the same I give
to my daughter.' Then Catherine thought of the
king: to her he was always her husband, and despite
his injustice, she would not address him but with respect.
Feeling that the end was not far off, she dictated
the following letter, at once so simple and so
noble:—</p>

<p class="nodent">'My most dear Lord, King, and Husband:</p>

<p>'The hour of my death now approaching, I cannot
choose but, out of the love I bear you, advise you of
your soul's health. You have cast me into many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
calamities and yourself into many troubles; but I forgive
you all, and pray God to do likewise. I commend
unto you Mary our daughter, beseeching you to be a
good father to her. Lastly, I make this vow, that mine
eyes desire you above all things.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_251" id="Ref_251" href="#Foot_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p class="gap-above2">The queen, therefore, sought to bid farewell of him
who had wrought her so much evil. Henry was moved,
and even shed tears,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_252" id="Ref_252" href="#Foot_252">[252]</a></span>
but did not comply with the
queen's wish: his conscience reproached him with his
faults. On the 7th January Catherine received the last
sacraments, and at two o'clock she expired.</p>

<p>Anne felt at the bottom of her heart the rights of this
princess. She had yielded to her imagination, to the
absolute will of the king; her marriage had given her
some moments of happiness, but her soul was often
troubled. She thought to herself that the proud Spanish
woman was the one to whom Henry had given his faith;
and doubted whether the crown did not belong to the
daughter of Isabella. Catherine's death removed her
anxieties. 'Now,' she said, 'now I am indeed a queen.'
She went into mourning, but according to the custom in
France at that period. The tears of the people accompanied
to the tomb that unhappy and (to say truth)
superstitious woman; but she was an affectionate
mother, a high-spirited wife, and a queen of indomitable
pride.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_253" id="Ref_253" href="#Foot_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>This decease was destined to effect great changes in
Europe. The emperor, who was forming a holy alliance
to replace his aunt on the throne, and who, to succeed,
had gone so far as to sacrifice the northern part of
Italy, having nothing more to do with Catherine, sheathed
his sword and kept Milan. Francis I., vexed at seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
the prey slip from him which he had so eagerly coveted,
and fancied already in his hands, went into a furious
passion, and prepared for a war to the death. The emperor
and the king of France, instead of marching together
against Henry, began each of them to court him,
desiring to have him for an ally in the fierce struggle
that was about to begin.</p>

<p>At the same time Catherine's death facilitated, as we
have said, the alliance of the king with the protestants
of Germany, who had maintained the validity of his
marriage with the princess of Aragon. One of their
chief grievances against Henry VIII. had thus disappeared.
Both sides now thought they could make a
step forward and strive to come to an understanding
theologically. The points on which they differed were
important. 'The king of England,' they said at Wittemberg,
'wishes to be pope in the place of the pope,
and maintains most of the errors of the old popery, such
as monasteries,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_254" id="Ref_254" href="#Foot_254">[254]</a></span>
indulgences, the mass, prayers for the
dead, and other Romish fables.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_255" id="Ref_255" href="#Foot_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DISCUSSION AT WITTEMBERG.=</p>

<p>The discussion began at Wittemberg. The champions
in the theological tournament were Bishop Fox
and Archdeacon Heath on one side; Melanchthon and
Luther on the other. Heath, one of the young doctors
whom Queen Anne had maintained at Cambridge
University, charmed Melanchthon exceedingly. 'He
excels in urbanity and sound doctrine,' said the latter.
Fox, on the other hand, who was the king's man, showed,
in Philip's opinion, no taste either for philosophy or for
agreeable and graceful conversation. The doctrine of
the mass was the principal point of the discussion.
They could not come to an understanding. Luther,
who thought it would be only a three days' matter,
seeing the time slip away, said to the elector: 'I have
done more in four weeks than these Englishmen in twelve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
years. If they continue reforming in that style, England
will never be <i>inside</i> or <i>out</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_256" id="Ref_256" href="#Foot_256">[256]</a></span>
This definition of the
English Reformation amused the Germans. They did
not discuss, they disputed: it became a regular quarrel.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_257" id="Ref_257" href="#Foot_257">[257]</a></span>
'I am disgusted with these debates,' said Luther to vice-chancellor
Burkhard, 'they make me sick.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_258" id="Ref_258" href="#Foot_258">[258]</a></span>
Even the
gentle Melanchthon exclaimed: 'All the world seems to
me to be burning with hatred and anger.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_259" id="Ref_259" href="#Foot_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly the theological discussions were broken
off, and the ambassadors of Henry VIII. were admitted
on the 12th of March into the presence of the elector.
'England is tranquil now,' said the bishop of Hereford;
'the death of a woman has forever terminated all
wrangling. At this moment the creed of Jesus Christ
alone is the concern of his Majesty. The king therefore
prays you to make an alliance between you and
him possible, by modifying a few points of your Confession.'
Whereupon the vice-chancellor of Saxony addressed
Luther: 'What can we concede to the king of
England?'—'Nothing,' answered the reformer. 'If we
had been willing to concede anything, we might just as
well have come to terms with the pope.' After this
very positive declaration, Luther softened down a little.
He knew well, as another reformer has said, 'that some
men are weaker than others, and if we do not treat them
very mildly, they lose their courage and turn away from
religion; and that Christians who are more advanced in
doctrine are bound to comfort the infirmities of the
ignorant.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_260" id="Ref_260" href="#Foot_260">[260]</a></span>
The Saxon reformer, retracing his steps a
little, wrote to the vice-chancellor: 'It is true that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
England cannot embrace the whole truth all at once.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_261" id="Ref_261" href="#Foot_261">[261]</a></span>
He thought it possible in certain cases to adopt other
expressions, and tolerate some diversity of usages.
'But,' he said, always firm in the faith, 'the great
doctrines can neither be given up nor modified. Whether
to make an alliance or not with the king, is for my most
gracious lord to decide: it is a secular matter. Only it
is dangerous to unite outwardly, when the hearts are
not in harmony.' The protestant states assembled on
the 24th of April, 1536, at Frankfort on the Main, required
Henry VIII. to receive <i>the faith confessed at Augsburg</i>,
and in that case expressed themselves ready to
acknowledge him as protector of the evangelical alliance.
The elector, who was much displeased with certain English
ceremonies, added: 'Let your Majesty thoroughly
reform the <i>pontifical idolomania</i> in England.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_262" id="Ref_262" href="#Foot_262">[262]</a></span>
It was
agreed that Melanchthon, Sturm, Bucer, and Dracon
should go to London to complete this great work of
union. England and evangelical Germany were about to
join hands.</p>

<p>This alliance of the king with the Lutherans deeply
chafed the catholics of the kingdom, already so seriously
offended by the suppression of the monasteries and the
punishment of the two men to whom Henry (they said)
was most indebted. While the Roman party was filled
with anger, the political party was surprised by the bold
step the prince had taken. But the blow which had
struck two great victims had taught them that they
must submit to the will of the monarch or perish. The
scaffolds of Fisher and More had read them a great lesson
of docility, and moulded all those around Henry to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
that servile spirit which leaves in the palace of a king
nothing but a master and slaves.</p>

<p>They were about to see an illustrious instance in the
trial of Anne Boleyn.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">ACCUSATION OF ANNE.<br />
 (<span class="smc">1535 to May 1536.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">If</span> feeble minds did not shrink from bending beneath
the royal despotism, men of fanatical mould cherished
vengeance in their hearts. Great wounds had been
inflicted on the papacy, and they burnt to strike some
signal blow against the cause of Reform. That also,
they said, must have its victim. For all these monasteries
sacrificed, one person must be immolated: one only,
but taken from the most illustrious station. The king
having, on the one side, struck his tutor and his friend,
must now, to maintain the balance, strike his wife on
the other. A tragedy was about to begin which would
terminate in a frightful catastrophe. Anne Boleyn had
not been brought up, as some have said, 'in the worst
school in Europe,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_263" id="Ref_263" href="#Foot_263">[263]</a></span>
but in one of the best—in the household
of the pious Margaret of Angoulême, who was the
enlightened protectress not only of the learned, but of
all friends of the Gospel. Anne had learnt from that
princess to love the Reformation and the Reformers.
And accordingly she was in the eyes of the papal partisans,
the principal cause of the change that had been
wrought in the king's mind, and by him throughout the
kingdom. The Reformation, as we have seen, began in
England about 1517 with the reading of the Holy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
Scriptures in the universities; but the most accredited
Roman doctors have preferred assigning it another
origin, and, speaking of Cranmer's connexion with Anne
Boleyn, thirteen years later, have said, 'Such is the
beginning of the Reformation in England.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_264" id="Ref_264" href="#Foot_264">[264]</a></span>
In this
assertion there is an error both of chronology and history.</p>

<p class="side">=CRANMER'S ELOQUENCE.=</p>

<p>Since her coronation, the queen had been in almost
daily communication with the archbishop of Canterbury,
and habitually—even her enemies affirmed it—the interests
of the evangelical cause were treated of. At one
time Anne prayed Cranmer to come to the assistance of
the persecuted protestants. At another, full of the necessity
of sending reapers into the harvest, she interested
herself about such young persons as were poor, but
whose pure morals and clear intellect seemed to qualify
them for the practice of virtue and the study of letters;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_265" id="Ref_265" href="#Foot_265">[265]</a></span>
these she assisted with great generosity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_266" id="Ref_266" href="#Foot_266">[266]</a></span>
This was also
an example that Margaret of Valois had given her. The
queen did not encourage these students heedlessly: she
required testimonials certifying as to the purity of their
morals and the capacity of their intellect. If she was
satisfied, she placed them at Oxford or Cambridge, and
required them to spread around them, even while studying,
the New Testament and the writings of the reformers.
Many of the queen's pensioners did great service
to the Church and State in after years. With these
queenly qualities Anne combined more domestic ones.
Cranmer saw her, like good Queen Claude, gathering
round her a number of young ladies distinguished by
their birth and their virtues, and working with them at
tapestry of admirable perfection for the palace of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
Hampton Court, or at garments for the indigent. She
established in the poor parishes vast warehouses, filled
with such things as the needy wanted. 'Her eye of
charity, her hand of bounty,' says a biographer, 'passed
through the whole land.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_267" id="Ref_267" href="#Foot_267">[267]</a></span>
'She is said in three quarters
of a year,' adds Lord Herbert of Cherbury, the celebrated
philosopher and historian, 'to have bestowed
fourteen or fifteen thousand pounds in this way,' that is,
in alms.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_268" id="Ref_268" href="#Foot_268">[268]</a></span>
And this distinguished writer, ambassador of
England at the court of Louis XIII., and known in
France by the exertions he made in behalf of the protestants,
adds: 'She had besides established a stock for
poor artificers in the realm.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_269" id="Ref_269" href="#Foot_269">[269]</a></span>
Such were the works of
Queen Anne. Cranmer, who had great discernment of
men and things, being touched by the regard which the
queen had for those who professed the Gospel, and seeing
all that she did for the Reformation and the consolation
of the wretched, declared that next to the king,
Anne was of all creatures living 'the one to whom he
was most bound.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_270" id="Ref_270" href="#Foot_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Cranmer was not the only person among the evangelicals
with whom Anne Boleyn entertained relations.
From the first day she had seen Latimer, the Christian
simplicity and apostolic manners of the reformer had
touched her. When she heard him preach, she was delighted.
The enthusiasm for that bold Christian preacher
was universal. 'It is as impossible,' said his hearers,
'for us to receive into our minds all the treasures of
eloquence and knowledge which fall from his lips, as it
would be for a little river to contain the waters of the
ocean in its bed.' From the period (1535) when Latimer
preached the Lent Sermons before the king, he was one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
of the most regular instruments of the queen's active
charity.</p>

<p>A still more decided reformer had a high esteem for
Anne Boleyn: this was Tyndale. No one, in his opinion,
had declared with so much decision as the queen in
favor of the New Testament and its circulation in English.
Wishing, accordingly, to show his gratitude and
respect, Tyndale presented her with a unique copy of his
translation, printed in beautiful type on vellum, illuminated
and bound in blue morocco, with these words in
large red letters: <i>Anne Regina Angliæ</i> (Anne, queen
of England).<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_271" id="Ref_271" href="#Foot_271">[271]</a></span>
This remarkable volume, now preserved
in the library of the British Museum, is a monument of
the veneration of the prisoner of Vilvorde for Anne
Boleyn. A manuscript manual of devotion for the use of
this princess has also been preserved: she used to present
copies of it to her maids of honor. We see in it the
value she attached to the Holy Scriptures: 'Give us, O
Father of Mercies,' we read, 'the greatest of all gifts
Thou hast ever conferred on man—the knowledge of
Thy holy will, and the glad tidings of our salvation.
Roman tyranny had long hidden it from us under Latin
letters; but now it is promulgated, published, and freely
circulated.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_272" id="Ref_272" href="#Foot_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PARKER'S CHRISTIAN CHARACTER.=</p>

<p>Anne having in 1535 lost Dr. Betts, one of her almoners,
looked out for a man devoted to the Gospel to take
his place, for she loved to be surrounded by the most
pious persons in England. She cast her eyes upon
Matthew Parker, a native of Norwich, professor at
Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and a man who for
two years had been preaching the truth with fervor.
Parker loved retirement and obscurity; accordingly,
when he received on the Wednesday following Palm
Sunday two letters summoning him to court 'because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
the queen wished to see him,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_273" id="Ref_273" href="#Foot_273">[273]</a></span>
he was amazed and confounded.
At first he wanted to refuse so brilliant a call;
but Latimer wrote to him: 'Show yourself to the world;
hide yourself no longer; do good, whilst you have the
opportunity. We know what you can do; let not your
will be less than your power.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_274" id="Ref_274" href="#Foot_274">[274]</a></span>
Parker went to London,
and in a short time his knowledge, piety, and prudence
gained the entire esteem of the queen. That modest,
intelligent, active man was just the person Anne wanted,
and she took pleasure thenceforward in bestowing on
him marks of her consideration. He himself tells us
that if, in the course of his duties, he was called upon to
receive friends at his table, the queen, eking out his
narrow means, would send him a hare or a fawn taken
in her parks.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_275" id="Ref_275" href="#Foot_275">[275]</a></span>
Parker was from this time one of those
employed by Anne to distribute her benevolence. He
had hardly arrived at court, when he presented to the
queen one W. Bill, a very young and very poor man,
but by no means wanting in talent. Anne, rich in discernment,
placed him in the number of students whom
she was preparing for the ministry: he afterwards became
dean of Westminster. Parker, who began his
career with Anne, was to finish it with Elizabeth.
When he was deprived of all his offices by Queen Mary
in 1554, he exclaimed: 'Now that I am stripped of
everything, I live in God's presence, and am full of joy
in my conscience. In this charming leisure I find
greater pleasures than those supplied by the busy and
perilous life I led at the court.' Forced to hide himself,
often to flee by night, to escape the pursuit of his persecutors,
the peace which he enjoyed was never troubled.
He looked upon trials as the privilege of the child of
God. All of a sudden a strange and unexpected calamity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
befell him. The daughter of Anne Boleyn, having
ascended the throne, desired to have her mother's
chaplain for archbishop of Canterbury and primate of
all England. 'I kneel before your Majesty,' he said to
Queen Elizabeth, 'and pray you not to burden me with
an office which requires a man of much more talent,
knowledge, virtue, and experience than I possess.' A
second letter from Chancellor Bacon repeated the summons.
Then the unhappy Parker exclaimed in the
depth of his sorrow: 'Alas! alas! Lord God! for what
times hast Thou preserved me!<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_276" id="Ref_276" href="#Foot_276">[276]</a></span>
I am come into deep
waters, where the floods overflow me. O Lord!
strengthen me by Thy mighty Spirit!' Parker was at
the head of the Church of England for sixteen years,
and dignified the elevated seat on which he had been
constrained to sit. Such were the men whom Anne
Boleyn gathered round her.</p>

<p>We should be mistaken, however, if we represented
the young queen as a bigot, living like Catherine in the
practices of a rigid austerity. It appears even doubtful
whether she knew by experience that inner, spiritual, and
living Christianity which was found in Latimer, Tyndale,
Cranmer, and Parker. She was a virtuous wife, a good
protestant, attached to the Bible, opposed to the pope,
fond of good works, esteeming men of God more than
courtiers: but she had not renounced the world and its
pomps. A woman of the world, upright, religious, loving
to do good, a class of which there is always a large
number, she was unacquainted with the pious aspirations
of a soul that lives in communion with God. Even her
position as queen and wife of Henry VIII. may have
hindered her from advancing in the path of a Christian
life. She thought it possible to love God without
renouncing the enjoyments of the age, and looked upon
worldly things as an innocent recreation. Desiring to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
keep her husband's heart, she endeavored to please him
by cheerful conversation, by organizing pleasure parties
of which she was the life, and by receiving all his
courtiers gracefully. Placed on a slippery soil and
watched by prejudiced eyes, she may occasionally have
let fall some imprudent expression. Her sprightliness
and gaiety, her amiable freedom were in strong contrast
with the graver and stiffer formalities of the English
ladies. Latimer, who saw her closely, sometimes admonished
her respectfully, when he was alone with her,
and the grateful Anne would exclaim unaffectedly: 'You
do me so much good!<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_277" id="Ref_277" href="#Foot_277">[277]</a></span>
Pray never pass over a single
fault.'</p>

<p class="side">=THE TRUTH ABOUT ANNE BOLEYN.=</p>

<p>It is not from the writings of the pamphleteers that
we must learn to know Anne Boleyn. Towards the end
of the sixteenth century, opposite parties, in their extreme
excitement, have painted her at one time in colors
too dark, at another in colors too flattering. We must
in this matter especially listen to men whose testimony
is sanctioned by universal respect. There are not many
princesses in history who have enjoyed, like Anne, the
esteem of the most elevated minds—of Cranmer and
Latimer, of Tyndale and Parker, and other Christians,
less illustrious, perhaps, but not less respectable. In the
eyes of the papal partisans, however, she had committed
an unpardonable crime: <i>she had separated England from
the papacy</i>; and accordingly their savage hatred has known
no bounds, and they have never ceased to blacken her
memory with their vile calumnies. Of all the misdeeds
that history can commit, the greatest consists in representing
the innocent as if they were guilty. It is wholesale
calumny for the use not only of the present generation
but for generations to come. Many writers have
forged and still forge base imputations against the
reformers Luther, Calvin, and others. Anne Boleyn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
has had her full share of slander in this huge conspiracy
of falsehood.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_278" id="Ref_278" href="#Foot_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>The grandeur with which Anne was surrounded, had
opened her heart to the tenderest sympathies. To be
the joy of her husband and the delight of her relations,
to protect the friends of the Gospel and to be loved
by England—these were for some time the dreams of
her young imagination. But ere long the crown of St.
Edward pressed heavily on her forehead. The members
of her own family became her enemies. Her uncle, the
proud duke of Norfolk, the chief along with Gardiner
of the ultramontane party, was animated by a secret
hatred against the young woman who was the support
of the evangelical party. Her father, the earl of Wiltshire,
imagining he saw that the king was not flattered at
being his son-in-law, had quitted London, regretting a
union which his ambition had so much desired. Lady
Rocheford, wife of Anne's brother, a woman of despicable
character, whose former perfidies the queen had
pardoned, and whom she had attached to the court,
repaid this generous magnanimity by secretly plotting the
ruin of a sister-in-law whose elevation had filled her
with jealousy. At length, one of those who ate her
bread and received favors from her, was about to show
her ingratitude to the unfortunate queen.</p>

<p>Among her ladies of honor was Jane Seymour, who
united all the attractions of youth and beauty, and whose
disposition held a certain mean between the severe
gravity of Queen Catherine and the fascinating sprightliness
of Queen Anne. Constancy in affection was not
a feature of Henry's character; his heart was easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
inflamed; his eye rested on the youthful Jane Seymour,
and no sooner had he become sensible of her graces,
than the charms of Anne Boleyn, which had formerly
captivated him, became unendurable. The genial
gaiety of the queen fatigued him; the accomplishments
which are ordinarily the means of pleasing, gave him
umbrage; the zeal she manifested for Protestantism
alienated him. Anne's enemies, especially the duke of
Norfolk and Lady Rocheford, observed this, and resolved
to take advantage of it to ruin the woman who
overshadowed them.</p>

<p class="side">=ANNE'S CHARACTER AND MANNERS.=</p>

<p>One circumstance, innocent enough of itself, favored
the designs of the queen's enemies. Anne, who had
been brought up in France, among a people distinguished
for their inexhaustible stores of gaiety, easy conversation,
witty and ingenious sallies, ironical phrases, and
amiable hearts, had brought something of all this to
London. Frank and prepossessing, she loved society;
and her ordinary manners seemed too easy among a
nation which, with deep affections, possesses much
gravity and external coldness. Anne had found a certain
freedom of speech in the court of France—it does
not appear that she even imitated it; but in a moment
of gaiety she might have let slip some keen railleries,
some imprudent words, and thus furnished her enemies
with weapons. She had some difficulty in conforming
with the strict etiquette of the court of England, and
had not been trained to the circumspection so necessary
with a husband like Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Anne was, at the same time, a friend of the Reformation
in the midst of a society that was catholic at
heart, and a Frenchwoman in the midst of an English
court; these were her two capital crimes. She was not
understood. Her gaiety did not degenerate into frivolity:
she did not possess that love of pleasure, which,
carried to excess, engenders corruption of manners; we
have named the truly pious men whom she loved to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
gather round her. But it was quite enough for some
persons that Anne was agreeable, like the ladies of St.
Germains and Fontainebleau, to suspect her of being a
flirt, like many of them. Moreover, she had married
above her station. Having lived at court as the equal
of the young nobles belonging to it, she was not always
able, after she ascended the throne, to keep herself on
the footing of a queen. From that time her enemies interpreted
unfavorably the innocent amiability with
which she received them. The mistrustful Henry VIII.
began to indulge in suspicions, and Viscountess Rocheford
endeavored to feed that prince's jealousy by crafty
and perfidious insinuations.</p>

<p class="side">=ANNE'S ANGUISH.=</p>

<p>Anne soon noticed the king's inclination for Jane Seymour:
a thousand trifles, apparently indifferent, had
struck her. She often watched the maid of honor; her
pride was offended, and jealousy tortured her heart
night and day. She endeavored to win back the king's
love; but Henry, who perceived her suspicions, grew
more angry with her every hour. The queen was not
far from her confinement; and it was at the very
moment when she hoped to give Henry the heir he had
longed for during so many years, that the king withdrew
from her his conjugal affection. Her heart was
wrung, and, foreseeing a mournful future, she doubted
whether a blow similar to that which had struck Catherine
might not soon be aimed at her. Jane Seymour
did not reject the king's advances. Historians of the
most opposite parties relate that one day, towards the
end of January 1536, the queen, unexpectedly entering
a room in the palace, found the king paying his court to
the young maid of honor in too marked a manner.
They may possibly exaggerate,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_279" id="Ref_279" href="#Foot_279">[279]</a></span>
but there is no doubt
that Henry gave cause for very serious complaints on
the part of his wife. It was as if a sword had pierced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
the heart of the unfortunate Anne Boleyn: she could
not bear up against so cruel a blow, and prematurely
gave birth to a dead son. God had at length granted
Henry that long-desired heir, but the grief of the
mother had cost the child's life. What an affliction for
her! For some time her recovery was despaired of.
When the king entered her room, she burst into tears.
That selfish prince, soured at the thought that she had
borne him a dead son, cruelly upbraided her misfortune,
instead of consoling her. It was too much: the poor
mother could not restrain herself. 'You have no one to
blame but yourself,' she exclaimed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_280" id="Ref_280" href="#Foot_280">[280]</a></span>
Henry, still more
angry, answered her harshly and left the apartment.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_281" id="Ref_281" href="#Foot_281">[281]</a></span>
These details are preserved by a well-informed writer of
the time of Elizabeth. To present Henry under so unfavorable
a light, if it were untrue, could hardly have
been an agreeable mode of paying court, as some have
insinuated, to a queen who took more after her father
than her mother.</p>

<p>Anne now foresaw the misfortunes awaiting her: she
recovered indeed after this storm, and exerted herself by
taking part once more in conversaziones and fêtes; but
she was melancholy and uneasy, like a foundering ship,
which reappears on the waves of the sea after the storm,
and still keeps afloat for a time, only to be swallowed
up at last. All her attempts to regain her husband's
affections were useless, and frightful dreams disturbed
her during the slumbers of the night. This agony lasted
three months.</p>

<p>The wind had changed: everybody noticed it, and it
was, to certain heartless courtiers, like the signal given
to an impatient pack of hounds. They set themselves
to hunt down the prey, which they felt they could rend
without danger. The ultramontanists regained their
courage. They had feared that, owing to Anne's intervention,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
the cause of Rome was lost in England, and
their alarm was not unreasonable. Cranmer, uniting
his efforts with those of the queen, never ceased pushing
forward the Reformation. When some one spoke in
the House of Lords about a General Council in Italy,
he exclaimed: 'It is the Word of God alone that we
must listen to in religious controversies.' At the same
time, in concert with Anne, he circulated all over
England a new Prayer-book, <i>the Primer</i>, intended to
replace the dangerous books of the priests.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_282" id="Ref_282" href="#Foot_282">[282]</a></span>
The people
used it. A pious and spiritual reader of that book
exclaimed one day, after meditating upon it: 'O bountiful
Jesu! O sweet Saviour! despise not him whom
Thou hast ransomed at the price of such a treasure—with
Thy blood! I look with confidence to the throne
of mercy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_283" id="Ref_283" href="#Foot_283">[283]</a></span>
Religion was becoming personal with Anne
Boleyn.</p>

<p class="side">=ANNE'S ZEAL FOR RELIGION.=</p>

<p>The queen and the archbishop had not stopped there:
they had attempted, so far as Henry would permit, to
place true shepherds over the flocks, instead of
merchants who traded with their wool. The bishopric
of Worcester, which had been taken from Ghinnucci,
was given (as we have seen) to Latimer; so that the
valley of the Severn, which four Italian bishops had
plundered for fifty years, possessed at last a pastor who
'planted there the plenteousness of Jesus Christ.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_284" id="Ref_284" href="#Foot_284">[284]</a></span>
Shaxton, another of Anne's chaplains, who at this time
professed a great attachment to Holy Scripture, had been
appointed bishop of Salisbury, in place of the famous
Cardinal Campeggio. Hilderly, formerly a Dominican
prior—who had at one time defended the immaculate
conception of the Virgin, but had afterwards acknowledged
and worshipped Jesus Christ as the only
Mediator—had been nominated to the see of Rochester,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
in place of the unfortunate Bishop Fisher. Finally,
George Brown, ex-provincial of the Augustines in
England—an upright man, a friend of the poor, and who,
caught by the truth, had exclaimed from the pulpit,
'Go to Christ and not to the saints!'—had been elected
archbishop of Dublin, and thus became the first
evangelical prelate of Ireland, a difficult post, which he
occupied at the peril of his life.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_285" id="Ref_285" href="#Foot_285">[285]</a></span>
Other prelates, like
Fox, bishop of Hereford, although not true Protestants,
proved themselves to be anti-Papists.</p>

<p>The members of the ultramontane party saw the
influence of the queen in all these nominations. Who
resisted the proposal that the English Church should be
represented at the General Council? Who endeavored
to make the king advance in the direction of the Reformation?
Who threw England into the arms of the
princes of Germany?—The queen, none but the queen.
She felt unhappy, it was said, when she saw a day pass
without having obtained some favor for the Reformation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_286" id="Ref_286" href="#Foot_286">[286]</a></span>
Men knew that the pope was ready to forgive
everything, and even to unite with Henry against
Charles V., if the king would submit to the conditions
laid down in the bull—that is to say, if he would put
away Anne Boleyn.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_287" id="Ref_287" href="#Foot_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>The condition required by the pontiff was not an
impossible one, for Henry liked to change his wives: he
had six. Marriage was not to him a oneness of life.
At the end of 1535, Anne had been his wife for three
years; it was a long time for him, and he began to turn
his eyes upon others. Jane Seymour's youth eclipsed
the queen's. Unfortunate Boleyn! Sorrow had gradually
diminished her freshness. Jane had natural allies,
who might help her to ascend the throne. Her two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
brothers, Edward and Thomas—the elder more moderate,
the younger more arrogant—each possessing great
ambition and remarkable capacity, thought that a
Seymour was as worthy as a Boleyn to wear the English
crown. The first blow did not however proceed from
them, but from a member of the queen's family—from
her sister-in-law. There is no room for indifference
between near relations: they love or, if they do not love,
they hate. Lady Rocheford, so closely allied to the
queen, felt continually piqued at her. Jealousy had
engendered a deep dislike in her heart, and this dislike
was destined to lead her on to contrive the death of the
detested object. Rendered desperate by the happiness
and especially by the greatness of Anne Boleyn, it
became her ruling passion to destroy them. One obstacle,
however, rose up before her. Lord Rocheford,
her husband and Anne's brother, would not enter into
her perfidious schemes. That depraved woman, who
afterwards suffered capital punishment for conniving at
crime, determined to ruin her sister-in-law and her husband
together. It was arranged that three of the courtiers
should give Henry the first hints. 'Thus began,'
says an author of that day, 'a comedy which was
changed into a sorrowful tragedy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_288" id="Ref_288" href="#Foot_288">[288]</a></span>
Nothing was
omitted that tended to the success of one of the most
infamous court intrigues recorded in history.</p>

<p>Anne became cognizant almost at the same time of
her sister-in-law's hatred of her and of her husband's
love for Jane Seymour. From that moment she foreboded
an early death, and her most anxious thoughts
were for her daughter. She wondered what would become
of the poor child, and, desirous of having her
brought up in the knowledge of the Gospel, she sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
for the pious simple-minded Parker, told him of her
apprehensions and her wishes, and commended Elizabeth
to him with all a mother's love.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_289" id="Ref_289" href="#Foot_289">[289]</a></span>
Anne's words
sank so deep into his heart that he never forgot them;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_290" id="Ref_290" href="#Foot_290">[290]</a></span>
and twenty-three years later, when that child, who had
become queen, raised him to the primacy, he declared
to Lord Burghley, that if he were not under such great
obligations to her mother, he would never have consented
to serve the daughter in such an elevated station.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_291" id="Ref_291" href="#Foot_291">[291]</a></span>
After consigning the youthful Elizabeth to the
care of a man of God, the unhappy queen was more at
ease.</p>

<p class="side">=CHARGES AGAINST ANNE.=</p>

<p>Meantime the plot was forming in silence, and two or
three circumstances, such as occur in the most innocent
life, were the pretext for Anne's destruction.</p>

<p>One day, when she was with the king at Winchester,
she sent for one of the court-musicians, named Smeton,
'to play on the virginals.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_292" id="Ref_292" href="#Foot_292">[292]</a></span>
This was the first count in
the indictment.</p>

<p>Norris, a gentleman of the king's chamber, was engaged
to Margaret, one of Anne's maids of honor, and
consequently was often in the queen's apartments.
Slanderous tongues affirmed that he went more for the
sake of his sovereign than for his betrothed. The
queen hearing of it, and desiring to stop the scandal,
determined to bind Norris to marry Margaret. 'Why
do you not go on with your marriage?' she asked him.
'I desire to wait a little longer,' answered the gentleman.
Anne, with the intent of making him understand
that there were serious reasons for not putting it off
any longer, added: 'It is said at court that you are
waiting for a dead man's shoes, and that if any misfortune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
befell the king, you would look to have me for
your wife.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_293" id="Ref_293" href="#Foot_293">[293]</a></span>
'God forbid!' exclaimed Norris, in alarm;
'if I had such an idea, it would be my destruction.'
'Mind what you are about,' resumed the queen, with
severity. Norris, in great emotion, went immediately
to Anne Boleyn's almoner. 'The queen is a virtuous
woman,' he said; 'I am willing to affirm it upon
oath.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_294" id="Ref_294" href="#Foot_294">[294]</a></span>
This was the second count in the indictment.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Weston, a bold frivolous man, was (although
married) very attentive to a young lady of the
court, a relative of the queen. 'Sir Francis,' said Anne,
who was distressed at his behavior, 'you love Mistress
Skelton, and neglect your wife.' 'Madam,' answered
the audacious courtier, 'there is one person in your
house whom I love better than both.' 'And who is
that?' said the queen. 'Yourself,' answered Weston.
Offended by such insolence, Anne ordered him, with
scorn and displeasure, to leave her presence.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_295" id="Ref_295" href="#Foot_295">[295]</a></span>
This
was the third count of the indictment.</p>

<p>Lord Rocheford, a man of noble and chivalrous
character, indignant at the calumnies which were
beginning to circulate against his sister, endeavored
to avert the storm. One day, when she kept her bed,
he entered her room to speak to her; and, the maids
of honor being present, he leant towards the queen,
to say something on this matter which was not fit
for the ears of strangers to the family. The infamous
Lady Rocheford made use of this innocent circumstance
to accuse her husband and sister-in-law of an
abominable crime.</p>

<p>Such are the four charges that were to cost Anne
Boleyn her life. Futile observations, malicious remarks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
to which persons are exposed in the world, and
especially at court, reached the ears of the king, and
inspired him with jealousy, reproaches, angry words,
and coldness. There was no more happiness for Anne.</p>

<p>There was enough in these stories to induce Henry VIII.
to reject his second wife, and take a third.
This prince—and it was the case generally with the
Tudors—had a temper at once decided and changeable,
a heart susceptible and distrustful, an energetic character,
and passions eager to be satisfied at any price.
Very mistrustful, he did not easily get the better of
his suspicions, and when any person had vexed him,
he was not appeased until he had got rid of him.
Common-sense generally appreciates at their true
worth such stories as those we have reported; but the
characters now on the stage were more irritable than
those usually to be found in the world. 'A tempest,'
says Lord Herbert of Cherbury on this subject, 'though
it scarce stir low and shallow waters, when it meets a
sea, both vexeth it, and makes it toss all that comes
thereon.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_296" id="Ref_296" href="#Foot_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry, happy to have found the pretext which his
new passion made him long for, investigated nothing;
he appeared to believe everything he was told. He
swore to prove Anne's guilt to others by the greatness
of his revenge. Of his six wives, he got rid of two
by divorce, two by the scaffold; only two escaped his
criminal humor. This time he was unwilling to
proceed by divorce; the tediousness of Catherine's
affair had wearied him. He preferred a more expeditious
mode—the axe.</p>

<p class="side">=COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY.=</p>

<p>On the 25th of April the king appointed a commission
to enquire into Anne's conduct, and placed on it the
duke of Norfolk, a maternal uncle but (as we have said)
an implacable enemy of the unfortunate queen; the
duke of Suffolk, who, as Henry's brother-in-law, served
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
him in his least desires; the earl of Oxford, a skilful
courtier; William Paulet, comptroller of the royal
household, whose motto was, 'To be a willow and not
an oak;' Audley, the honestest of all, but still his master's
humble servant; Lord Delawarr, and several other
lords and gentlemen, to the number of twenty-six. It
has been said, by Burnet and others, that the king
named Anne's father, the earl of Wiltshire, one of the
judges. It would, no doubt, have been the most striking
trait of cruelty, of which Henry gave so many proofs;
but we must in justice declare that the wretched prince
did not perpetrate such a monstrosity. Burnet, after
the most searching investigations, retracted his error.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_297" id="Ref_297" href="#Foot_297">[297]</a></span>
On Thursday, the 27th of April, the king, understanding
the necessity of a Parliament to repeal the laws made in
favor of Anne and her children, issued writs for its assembling.
He was resolved to hurry on the business—equally
impatient to hear no more of his wife, and to
possess her who was the object of his desires.</p>

<p>Anne, who was ignorant of what was going on, had
gradually recovered a little serenity, but it was not so
with those around her. The court was agitated and uneasy.
The names of the commissioners were canvassed,
and people wondered where the terrible blows of the
king would fall. Many were alarmed for themselves or
their friends. Would the storm burst on Sir Thomas
Wyatt, who wrote verses in Anne's honor? or on Lord
Northumberland, whom the queen had loved before
Henry cast his eyes upon her? The king did not intend
to go so high.</p>

<p>The indecision did not last long. At two o'clock on
the 27th of April—the very day when the writs for the
new Parliament were issued—William Brereton, one of
the gentlemen of the king's household, pointed out by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
the queen's enemies, was arrested and taken to the
Tower. Two days later, on the 29th of April, Anne was
crossing the presence-chamber, where a miserable creature
happened to be present at that moment. It was
Mark Smeton, the court-musician—a vain, cowardly,
corrupt man, who had felt hurt because, since the day
when he had played before the queen at Winchester,
that princess had never even looked at him. He was
standing, in a dejected attitude, leaning against a window.
It is possible that, having heard of the disgrace
that threatened the queen, he hoped, by showing his
sorrow, to obtain from her some mark of interest. Be
that as it may, his unusual presence in that room, the
posture he had assumed, the appearance of sorrow
which he had put on, were evidently intended to attract
her attention. The trick succeeded. Anne noticed him
as she passed by. 'Why are you sad?' she asked. 'It
is no matter, madam.' The queen fancied that Smeton
was grieved because she had never spoken to him.
'You may not look to have me speak to you,' she added,
'as if you were a nobleman, because you are an inferior
person.' 'No, madam,' replied the musician, 'I need
no words; a look sufficeth me.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_298" id="Ref_298" href="#Foot_298">[298]</a></span>
He did not receive
the look he asked for, and his wounded vanity urged
him from that moment to ruin the princess, by whom he
had the insolence to wish to be remarked. Smeton's
words were reported to the king, and next day (April
30), the musician was arrested, examined at Stepney,
and sent to the Tower.</p>

<p class="side">=TOURNAMENT AT GREENWICH.=</p>

<p>A magnificent festival was preparing at Greenwich,
to celebrate the First of May in the usual manner.
This was the strange moment which Henry had chosen
for unveiling his plans. In certain minds there appears
to be a mysterious connection between festivities and
bloodshed; another prince (Nero) had shown it in old
times, and some years later Charles IX. was to celebrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
the marriage of his sister Margaret by the massacres of
St. Bartholomew. Henry VIII. gave to two of the
victims he was about to immolate the foremost places
in the brilliant tournament he had prepared. Lord
Rocheford, the queen's brother, was the principal challenger,
and Henry Norris was chief of the defenders. Sir
Francis Weston was also to take part in these jousts.
Henry showed himself very gracious to them, and hid
with smiles their approaching destruction. The king
having taken his place, and the queen, in a magnificent
costume, being seated by his side, Rocheford and Norris
passed before him, lowering their spears—<i>morituri te
salutant</i>. The jousting began immediately after. The
circumstances of the court gave a gloomy solemnity to
the festival. The king, who was watching with fixed
eyes the struggles of his courtiers, started up all of a
sudden, with every appearance of anger, and hastily
quitted the balcony. What had happened? The
ultramontane Sanders, notorious as being a most
malicious and fabulous writer, mentions that the queen
had dropped her handkerchief into the lists, and that
Norris took it up and wiped his face with it. Lord
Herbert, Burnet, and others affirm that there is nothing
to corroborate the story, which, were it true, might be
very innocent. However, the festivities were interrupted
by the king's departure. The confusion was
universal, and the alarmed queen withdrew, eager to
know the cause of the strange procedure.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_299" id="Ref_299" href="#Foot_299">[299]</a></span>
Thus ended
the rejoicings of the First of May.</p>

<p>Henry, who had gone back to the palace, hearing of
the queen's return, refused to see her, ordered her to
keep her room, mounted his horse, and, accompanied
by six gentlemen, galloped back to London. Slackening
his pace for a time, he took Norris aside, and,
telling him the occasion of his anger, promised to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
pardon him if he would confess. Norris answered, with
firmness and respect: 'Sire, if you were to cut me open
and take out my heart, I could only tell you what I
know.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_300" id="Ref_300" href="#Foot_300">[300]</a></span>
On reaching Whitehall, Henry said to his
ministers: 'To-morrow morning you will take Rocheford,
Norris, and Weston to the Tower; you will then
proceed to Greenwich, arrest the queen, and put her in
prison. Finally, you will write to Cranmer and bid
him go immediately to Lambeth, and there await my
orders.' The victims were seized, and the high-priest
summoned for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>The night was full of anguish to Anne Boleyn, and
the next day, when she was surrounded by her ladies,
their consternation increased her terror. It seemed
to her impossible that a word from her would not
convince her husband of her innocence. 'I will positively
see the king,' she exclaimed. She ordered her
barge to be prepared, but, just as she was about to set
out, another barge arrived from London, bringing
Cromwell, Audley, and the terrible Kingston, lieutenant
of the Tower. That ominous presence was a
death-warrant: on seeing him the queen screamed
aloud.</p>

<p class="side">=ANNE BEFORE THE COUNCIL.=</p>

<p>They did not, however, remove her at once: the
council, on which sat her most violent adversaries,
assembled in the palace, and Anne was summoned to
appear before it. The duke of Norfolk, the president,
informed her coldly of what she was accused, and
named her pretended accomplices. At these words,
the queen, struck with astonishment and sorrow, fell
on her knees and cried out: 'O Lord, if I am guilty,
may I never be forgiven!' Then, recovering a little
from her emotion, she replied to the calumnious charges
brought against her, to which Norfolk answered carelessly
and contemptuously, as if he were still speaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
to the little girl whom he had seen born, 'Tut, tut,
tut,' and shook his head disdainfully.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_301" id="Ref_301" href="#Foot_301">[301]</a></span>
'I desire to see
the king,' said Anne. 'Impossible,' answered the duke;
'that is not included in our commission.' 'I have been
very cruelly treated,' said Anne Boleyn, later, when
speaking of this horrible conversation with her uncle.
'It is his Majesty's good pleasure that we conduct you to
the Tower,' added Norfolk. 'I am ready to obey,' said
the queen, and all went in the same barge. When they
reached the Tower, Anne landed. The governor was
there to receive her. Norfolk and the other members
of the council committed her into his charge and departed.
It was five in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Then the gates of the fortress opened; and at this
moment, when she was crossing the threshold under
the charge of heinous crimes, Anne remembered how,
three years before, she had entered it in triumph for
the ceremony of her coronation, in the midst of the
general acclamations of the people. Struck by the
fearful contrast, she fell on her knees 'as a ball,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_302" id="Ref_302" href="#Foot_302">[302]</a></span>
and
exclaimed, 'O Lord, help me, as I am guiltless of that
whereof I am accused!' The governor raised her up,
and they entered. She expected to be put into close
confinement. 'Mr. Kingston,' she said, 'shall you put
me into a dungeon?' 'No, madam,' answered the
governor; 'you will be in your own lodging, where you
lay at your coronation.' 'It is too good for me,' she
exclaimed. She entered, however, and on reaching
those royal chambers, which recalled such different
recollections, she knelt again and burst into tears. The
violence of her grief presently brought on convulsive
movements, and her tears were succeeded by hysterical
laughter.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_303" id="Ref_303" href="#Foot_303">[303]</a></span>
Gradually she came to herself, and tried to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
collect her thoughts. Feeling the need of strengthening
herself by the evidences of the Lord's love, she said to
Kingston, 'Entreat his Majesty to let me have the
sacrament.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_304" id="Ref_304" href="#Foot_304">[304]</a></span>
Then, in the consciousness of innocence,
she added, 'Sir, I am as clear from the company of man
as I am of you. I am the king's true wedded wife.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_305" id="Ref_305" href="#Foot_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ANNE'S SYMPATHY.=</p>

<p>She was not absorbed in her own misfortunes: she
was moved by the sufferings of the others, and uneasy
about her brother. 'Can you tell me where Lord
Rocheford is?' she asked. Kingston replied that he
had seen him at Whitehall. She was not tranquillized
by this evasive answer. 'Oh, where is my sweet
brother?' she exclaimed. There was no reply. 'Mr.
Kingston,' resumed Anne, after a few moments, 'do
you know why I am here?' 'No, madam.' 'I hear
say that I am to be accused of criminal familiarities.'
(Norfolk had told her so in the barge.) 'I can say no
more than—Nay!' Suddenly tearing one of her garments,
she exclaimed, as if distracted: 'If they were to
open my body, I should still say—No.' After this her
mind wandered. She thought of her mother, and the
love she felt for the countess of Wiltshire made her feel
more than anything else the bitterness of her situation:
she imagined the proud lady was before her, and cried,
with unutterable agony, 'O my mother, my mother,
thou wilt die for sorrow!' Then her gloomy thoughts
were turned to other objects. She remembered that,
while in the barge, the duke of Norfolk had named
Norris and Smeton as her accusers, which was partly
false. The miserable musician was not grieved at being
wrongfully accused of a crime likely to make him
notorious, but Norris had stoutly rejected the idea that
the queen could be guilty. 'O Norris, hast thou accused
me!' she ejaculated; 'and thou too, Smeton!' After
a few moments' silence, Anne fixed her eyes on the
governor. 'Mr. Kingston,' she asked, 'shall I die
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
without justice?' 'Madam,' answered the governor,
'the meanest subject of the king has that.' At these
words the queen again laughed hysterically. 'Justice—justice!'
she exclaimed, with disdainful incredulity.
She counted less upon justice than the humblest of her
subjects. Gradually the tempest calmed down, and the
silence of the night brought relief to her sorrow.</p>

<p>The same day (May 2) the news spread through
London that the queen was arrested. Cranmer, who
had received the royal intimation to go to his palace
at Lambeth, and wait there until further orders, had
arrived, and was thunderstruck on hearing what had
happened. 'What! the queen in prison! the queen an
adulteress!'... A struggle took place in his
bosom. He was indebted to the queen for much; he
had always found her irreproachable—the refuge of the
unhappy, the upholder of the truth. He had loved her
like a daughter, respected her as his sovereign. That
she was innocent, he had no doubt; but how account
for the behavior of the king? The unhappy prelate
was distracted by the most painful thoughts during the
whole of Tuesday night. This truly pious man showed
excessive indulgence towards Henry VIII., and bent
easily beneath his powerful hand; but his path was
clearly traced—to maintain unhesitatingly the innocence
of her whom he had always honored. And yet he was
to be an example of the fascination exerted by a despot
over such characters—of the cowardice of which a good
man may be guilty through human respect. Doubtless
there are extenuating circumstances in his case. It
was not only the queen's fate that made the prelate
uneasy, but also the future of the Reformation. If love
for Anne had helped to make Henry incline to the side
of the Reformation, the hatred which he now felt
against his unhappy wife might easily drive him into
the other direction. Cranmer desired to prevent this
at any price, and accordingly thought himself obliged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
to use extreme precaution. But these circumstances
are really no extenuation. No motive in the world can
excuse a man from not frankly defending his friends
when they are falsely accused—from not vindicating an
innocent woman when she is declared to be guilty.
Cranmer wrote to the king: 'I cannot without your
Majesty's command appear in your presence; but I can
at least desire most humbly, as is my duty, that your
great wisdom and God's help may remove the deep
sorrow of your heart.</p>

<p class="side">=CRANMER'S LETTER TO HENRY.=</p>

<p>'I cannot deny that your Majesty has great cause to be
overwhelmed with sorrow. In fact, whether the things
of which men speak be true or not, your honor, Sire, according
to the false appreciation of the world, has
suffered; and I do not remember that Almighty God
has ever before put your Majesty's firmness to so severe
a proof.</p>

<p>'Sire, I am in such a perplexity that I am clean
amazed; for I never had a better opinion in woman
than I had of her, which maketh me think that she cannot
be culpable.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_306" id="Ref_306" href="#Foot_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>This was tolerably bold, and accordingly Cranmer
hastened to tone down his boldness. 'And yet, Sire,' he
added, 'would you have gone so far, if you had not been
sure of her crime?... Your Grace best knoweth
that, next unto your Grace, I was most bound unto
her of all creatures living. Wherefore I must humbly
beseech your Grace to suffer me in that which both God's
law, nature, and her kindness bindeth me, unto that I
may (with your Grace's favor) wish and pray for her.
And from what condition your Grace, of your only mere
goodness, took her, and set the crown upon her head, I
repute him not your Grace's faithful servant and subject,
nor true to the realm, that would not desire the offence
to be without mercy punished, to the example of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
others. And as I loved her not a little, for the love I
judged her to bear towards God and His holy Gospel;
so, if she be proved guilty, there is not one that loveth
God and His Gospel that will ever favor her, for then
there never was creature in our time that so much slandered
the Gospel.</p>

<p>'However,' he added, appearing to recover his courage,
'forget not that God has shown His goodness to
your Grace in many ways, and has never injured you;
whilst your Grace, I am sure, acknowledged that you
have offended Him. Extend, therefore, to the Gospel the
precious favor you have always shown it, and which proceedeth
not from your love for the queen your wife, but
from your zeal for the truth.</p>

<p style="font-size:80%">'From Lambeth, 3d of May, 1636.'</p>

<p>When Cranmer addressed these soothing words to
the king, it was doubtless on the supposition (on which
he gives no opinion) that Anne was guilty. But, even
admitting this hypothesis, is it not carrying flattery of
the terrible autocrat very far, to compare him with Job
as the prelate does? In another part of this letter he
says: 'By accepting all adversity, without despair and
without murmuring, your Grace will give opportunity
to God to multiply His blessings, as He did to His
faithful servant Job, to whom, after his great calamity,
and to reward his patience, He restored the double of
what He had possessed.' As regards the king, Cranmer
had found for himself a false conscience, which led him
into deceitful ways: his letter, although he still tries
to defend Anne, cannot be justified.</p>

<p>He was about to dispatch the letter, when he received
a message from the lord-chancellor, desiring
him to come to the Star-Chamber. The archbishop
hastened across the Thames, and found at the appointed
place not only Audley, but the Lords Oxford and
Sussex, and the lord-chamberlain. These noblemen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
laid before him the charges brought against Anne
Boleyn, adding that they could be proved, though they
did not themselves produce any proof. On his return to
Lambeth, Cranmer added a postscript to his letter, in
which he expressed his extreme sorrow at the report
that had just been made to him.</p>

<p class="side">=CRUELTY TO ANNE BOLEYN.=</p>

<p>The morning of the same day (May 3) was a sad one
in the Tower. By a refinement of cruelty, the king
had ordered two of the queen's enemies—Lady Boleyn
and Mistress Cosyns—to be always near her; to which
end they slept in her room, while Kingston and his
wife slept outside against her chamber-door. What
could be the object of these strange precautions? We
can only see one. Every word that fell from Anne, even
in her convulsions or in her dreams, would be perfidiously
caught up, and reported to the king's agents
with malicious interpretations. Anne, pardoning the
former conduct of these ladies, and wholly engrossed
with her father's sorrow, thought she might ask for
news about him from the persons who had been given
her for companions; but those wicked women, who
never spoke to her without rudeness, refused to give
her any information. 'The king knew what he was
doing,' said Anne to Kingston, 'when he put these two
women about me. I could have desired to have two
ladies of my chamber, persons whom I love; but his
Majesty has had the cruelty to give me those whom I
could never endure.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_307" id="Ref_307" href="#Foot_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>The punishment continued. Lady Boleyn, hoping
to detect some confusion in her niece's face, told her
that her brother, Lord Rocheford, was also in the
Tower. Anne, who had somewhat recovered her
strength, answered calmly, 'I am glad to learn that
he is so near me.' 'Madam,' added Kingston, 'Weston
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
and Brereton are also under my charge.' The queen
remained calm.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_308" id="Ref_308" href="#Foot_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>She purposed, however, to vindicate herself, and her
first thought turned towards two of the most pious
men in England: 'Oh, if God permitted me,' she said,
'to have my bishops (meaning Cranmer and Latimer),
they would plead to the king for me.' She then remained
silent for a few minutes. A sweet reflection
passed through her mind and consoled her. Since
she had undertaken the defence of the persecuted
evangelicals, gratitude would doubtless impel them to
pray for her. 'I think,' she said, 'that the greater
part of England is praying for me.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_309" id="Ref_309" href="#Foot_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>Anne had asked for her almoner, and, as some hours
had elapsed without his arrival, gloomy images once
more arose to sadden her mind. 'To be a queen,'
she said, 'and to be treated so cruelly—treated as
queen never was before!' Then, as if a ray of sunshine
had scattered the clouds, she exclaimed: 'No,
I shall not die—no, I will not die!... The king has
put me in prison only to prove me.' The terrible
struggle was too great for the young woman: she
had convulsions and fits, and almost lost her senses.
Attacked by a fresh hysterical paroxysm, the unfortunate
lady burst into laughter. On coming to herself
after a while, she cried: 'I will have justice ...
justice ... justice!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_310" id="Ref_310" href="#Foot_310">[310]</a></span>
Kingston, who was present,
bowed and said: 'Assuredly, madam.' 'If any man
accuses me,' she continued, 'I can only say—No. They
can bring no witness against me.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_311" id="Ref_311" href="#Foot_311">[311]</a></span>
Then she had, all
at once, an extraordinary attack: she fell down in delirium,
and with eyes starting, as if she were looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
into the future, and could foresee the chastisement
with which God would punish the infamous wickedness
of which she was the victim, she exclaimed: 'If I am
put to death, there will be great judgments upon England
for seven years.... And I ... I shall be in
heaven ... for I have done many good deeds during
my life.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_312" id="Ref_312" href="#Foot_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=AN UNJUST TRIBUNAL.=</p>

<p><span class="smc">Everything</span> was preparing for the unjust judgment
which was to have so cruel a termination. Justice is
bound to watch that the laws are observed, and to punish
the guilty; but if law is to be just law, the judges
must listen fairly to the accused, diligently discharge
all the duties to which their office calls them, and not
permit themselves to be influenced either by the presents
or the solicitations, the threats or the favors, or the rank
(even should it be royal) of the prosecutor. Their decisions
should be inspired only by such motives as they
can give an account of to the Supreme Judge; their
sentences must be arrived at through attentive consideration
and serious reflection. For them there are no
other guides than impartiality, conscience, and law.
But the queen was not to appear before such judges:
those who were about to dispose of her life set themselves
in opposition to these imperious conditions.</p>

<p>Henry's agents redoubled their exertions to obtain,
either from the ladies of the court or from the accused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
men, some deposition against Anne; but it was in vain.
Even the women whom her elevation had eclipsed could
allege nothing against her. Henry Norris, William
Brereton, and Sir Francis Weston were carefully interrogated,
one after the other: the examiners tried to
make them confess their adultery, but they stoutly denied
it; whereupon the king's agents, who were determined
to get at something, began a fresh inquiry,
and cross-examined the prisoners. It is believed that
the gentlemen of the court were exempted from torture,
but that the rack was applied to Mark Smeton, who was
thus made to confess all they wanted.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_313" id="Ref_313" href="#Foot_313">[313]</a></span>
It is more
probable that the vile musician, a man of weak head and
extreme vanity, being offended that his sovereign had not
condescended even to look at him, yielded to the vengeance
of irritated self-esteem. The queen had not
been willing to give him the honor of a look—he boasted
of adultery. The three gentlemen persevered in their
declaration touching the queen's innocence: Lord
Rocheford did the same.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_314" id="Ref_314" href="#Foot_314">[314]</a></span>
The disheartened prosecutor
wrote to the Lord-Treasurer: 'This is to inform you
that no one, except Mark, will confess anything against
her; wherefore I imagine, if there be no other evidence,
the business will be injurious to the king's honor.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_315" id="Ref_315" href="#Foot_315">[315]</a></span>
The lawyers knew the value to be given to the musician's
words. If the verdict was left to the equitable interpretation
of the law—if the king did not bring his sovereign
influence to bear upon the decisions of the judges, there
could be no doubt as to the issue of the hateful trial.</p>

<p>But every passion was at work to paralyze the power
of right. Vainly the queen's innocence shone forth on
every side—the conspiracy formed against her grew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
stronger every day. To the wickedness of Lady Rocheford,
the jealousies of an intriguing <i>camarilla</i>, the hatred
of the ultramontane party, the unbridled ambition
aroused in certain families by the prospects of the despot's
couch soon to be empty though stained with blood,
and to the instability of weak men, was added the strong
will of Henry VIII., as determined to get rid of Anne
by death as he had been to separate from Catherine by
divorce. The queen understood that she must die; and,
wishing to be prepared, she sought to wean herself from
that life which had so many attractions for her. She
felt that the pleasures she had so enjoyed were vain;
the knowledge that she had endeavored to acquire,
superficial; the virtue to which she had aspired, imperfect;
and the active life she had desired, without decisive
results. The vanity of all created things, once proclaimed
by one who also had occupied a throne, struck
her heart. Everything being taken from her, she renounced</p>

<p class="center small">Le vain espoir de ce muable monde.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_316" id="Ref_316" href="#Foot_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p class="nodent">Anne, giving up everything, turned towards a better
life, and sought to strengthen herself in God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_317" id="Ref_317" href="#Foot_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ANNE SEEKS THE BETTER LIFE.=</p>

<p>Such were her affecting dispositions when the duke
of Norfolk, accompanied by other noblemen, came in
the king's name to set before her the charges brought
against her, to summon her to speak the truth, and to
assure her that, if she confessed her fault, the king
might pardon her. Anne replied with the dignity of a
queen still upon the throne, and with the calmness of a
Christian at the gates of eternity. She threw back with
noble indignation the vile accusations of which the
royal commissioners were the channel:</p>

<p class="center small">A ces seigneurs, parlant comme maîtresse.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_318" id="Ref_318" href="#Foot_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></div>

<p>'You call upon me to speak the truth,' she said to
Norfolk. 'Well then, the king shall know it,' and
she dismissed the lords. It was beneath her to plead
her cause before these malicious courtiers, but she
would tell her husband the truth. Left alone, she sat
down to write that celebrated letter, a noble monument
of the elevation of her soul; a letter full of the tenderest
complaints and the sharpest protests, in which her
innocence shines forth, and which combines at once so
much nature and eloquence that in the opinion of the
most competent judges it deserves to be handed down
to posterity. It ran as follows:—</p>

<p class="side">=ANNE BOLEYN'S LETTER.=</p>

<p>'Your Grace's displeasure and my imprisonment are
things so strange unto me, that what to write, or what
to excuse, I am altogether ignorant. Whereas you
sent to me (willing me to confess a truth and so obtain
your favor), by such a one whom you know to be my
ancient professed enemy; I no sooner received this
message by him, than I rightly conceived your meaning;
and if, as you say, confessing a truth indeed may procure
my safety, I shall with all willingness and duty perform
your command.</p>

<p>'But let not your Grace ever imagine that your poor
wife will ever be brought to acknowledge a fault, where
not so much as a thought thereof ever proceeded. And,
to speak truth, never a prince had wife more loyal in all
duty and in all true affection, than you have ever found
in Anne Boleyn—with which name and place I could
willingly have contented myself, if God and your Grace's
pleasure had so pleased. Neither did I at any time so
far forget myself in my exaltation or received queenship,
but that I always looked for such alteration as I
now find; for the ground of my preferment being on
no surer foundation than your Grace's fancy, the least
alteration was fit and sufficient (I knew) to draw that
fancy to some other subject.</p>

<p>'You have chosen me from a low estate to be your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
queen and companion, far beyond my desert or desire.
If then you found me worthy of such honor, good your
Grace, let not any light fancy or bad counsel of my
enemies withdraw your princely favor from me; neither
let that stain—that unworthy stain—of a disloyal heart
towards your good Grace ever cast so foul a blot on me
and on the infant princess, your daughter.</p>

<p>'Try me, good king, but let me have a lawful trial,
and let not my sworn enemies sit as my accusers and as
my judges; yea, let me receive an open trial, for my
truth shall fear no open shames. Then shall you see
either mine innocence cleared, your suspicions and conscience
satisfied, the ignominy and slander of the world
stopped—or my guilt openly declared; so that whatever
God and you may determine of, your Grace may be freed
from an open censure, and mine offence being so lawfully
proved, your Grace may be at liberty, both before God
and man, not only to execute worthy punishment on me,
as an unfaithful wife, but to follow your affection already
settled on that party, for whose sake I am now as I am;
whose name I could, some good while since, have
pointed unto, your Grace being not ignorant of my
suspicion therein. But if you have already determined
of me, and that not only my death but an infamous
slander must bring you the joying of your desired happiness,
then I desire of God that He will pardon your
great sin herein, and likewise my enemies, the instruments
thereof; and that He will not call you to a strict
account for your unprincely and cruel usage of me at
His general judgment-seat, where both you and myself
must shortly appear; and in whose just judgment, I
doubt not (whatsoever the world may think of me), mine
innocency shall be openly known and sufficiently
cleared.</p>

<p>'My last and only request shall be, that myself may
only bear the burden of your Grace's displeasure, and
that it may not touch the innocent souls of those poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
gentlemen, who, as I understand, are likewise in strait
imprisonment for my sake. If ever I have found favor
in your sight—if ever the name of Anne Boleyn have
been pleasing in your ears—then let me obtain this
request; and so I will leave to trouble your Grace any
further; with mine earnest prayer to the Trinity to
have your Grace in His good keeping, and to direct
you in all your actions.</p>

<p>'From my doleful prison in the Tower, the 6th of
May.</p>

<div class="foot">
<div class="right1">'<span class="smc">Anne Boleyn.</span>'</div>
</div>

<p>We see Anne thoroughly in this letter, one of the
most touching that was ever written. Injured in her
honor, she speaks without fear, as one on the threshold
of eternity. If there were no other proofs of her
innocence, this document alone would suffice to gain
her cause in the eyes of an impartial and intelligent
posterity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_319" id="Ref_319" href="#Foot_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=EFFECT OF ANNE'S LETTER ON HENRY.=</p>

<p>That noble letter aroused a tempest in the king's
heart. The firm innocence stamped on it; the mention
of Henry's tastes, and especially of his inclination
for Jane Seymour; Anne's declaration that she had
anticipated her husband's infidelity, the solemn appeal
to the day of judgment, and the thought of the injury
which such noble language would do to his reputation—all
combined to fill that haughty prince with vexation,
hatred, and wrath. That letter gives the real
solution of the enigma. A guilty caprice had inclined
Henry to Anne Boleyn; another caprice inclined him
now to Jane Seymour. This explanation is so patent
that no one need look for another.</p>

<p>Henry determined to inflict a great humiliation upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
this daring woman. He would strip her of the name of
wife, and pretend that she had only been his concubine.
As his marriage with Catherine of Aragon had been
declared null because of her union with his brother
Arthur, Henry imagined that his marriage with Anne
Boleyn might be annulled because of an attachment
once entertained for her by Percy, afterwards duke of
Northumberland. When that nobleman was summoned
before Cromwell, he thought that he also was to be
thrown into the Tower as the queen's lover; but the
summons had reference to quite a different matter.
'There was a pre-contract of marriage between you and
Anne Boleyn?' asked the king's vicar-general. 'None
at all,' he answered; and in order that his declaration
might be recorded, he wrote it down and sent it to
Cromwell. In it he said: 'Referring to the oath I
made in this matter before the archbishops of Canterbury
and York, and before the Blessed Body of our
Saviour, which I received in the presence of the duke
of Norfolk, and others of his majesty's counsellors, I
acknowledge to have eaten the Holy Sacrament to my
condemnation, if there was any contract or promise of
marriage between the queen and me. This 13th of
May, in the twenty-eighth year of his majesty King
Henry VIII.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_320" id="Ref_320" href="#Foot_320">[320]</a></span>
This declaration was clear, but the
barbarous monarch did not relinquish his idea.</p>

<p>A special commission had been appointed, on the
24th of April, 'to judge of certain offences committed
at London, Hampton Court, and Greenwich.' They
desired to give to this trial the appearance at least of
justice; and as the alleged offences were committed in
the counties of Middlesex and Kent, the indictment
was laid before the grand juries of both counties. On
the 20th of May they found a true bill. The writers
favorable to Henry VIII. in this business—and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
are few—have acknowledged that these 'hideous
charges' (to use the words of one of them) were but
fables invented at pleasure, and which 'overstepped
all ordinary bounds of credulity.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_321" id="Ref_321" href="#Foot_321">[321]</a></span>
Various explanations
have been given of the conduct of these juries;
the most natural appears to be that they accommodated
themselves, according to the servile manner of the
times, to the king's despotic will, which was always to
be feared, but more especially in matters that concerned
his own person.</p>

<p>The acts that followed were as prompt as they were
cruel. Two days after (on May 12) Norris, Weston,
Brereton, and the musician were taken to Westminster,
and brought before a commission composed of the dukes
of Norfolk and Suffolk, Henry's two intimates, and
other lords, and it is even said that the earl of Wiltshire
was present.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_322" id="Ref_322" href="#Foot_322">[322]</a></span>
The three gentlemen repelled the charge
with unshakable firmness. 'I would endure a thousand
deaths,' said Norris, 'sooner than betray the
innocent. I declare, upon my honor, that the queen is
innocent, and am ready to support my testimony in
arms against all the world.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_323" id="Ref_323" href="#Foot_323">[323]</a></span>
When this language of
Henry VIII.'s favorite was reported to that prince, he
cried out: 'Hang him up, then—hang him up!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_324" id="Ref_324" href="#Foot_324">[324]</a></span>
The wretched musician alone confessed a crime which
would give him a place in history. He did not reap
the reward promised to his infamy. Perhaps it was
imagined that his death would guarantee his silence,
and that his punishment would corroborate his defamations.
The three gentlemen were condemned to
be beheaded, and the musician to be hanged.</p>

<p class="side">=QUEEN ANNE'S TRIAL.=</p>

<p>Three days later (on May 15) the queen and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
brother were taken before their peers in the great hall
of the Tower, to which the Lord Mayor and a few
aldermen and citizens alone were admitted. The duke
of Norfolk had received orders to assemble a certain
number of peers to form a court: they were twenty-six
in all, and most of them enemies of Anne and of the
Reformation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_325" id="Ref_325" href="#Foot_325">[325]</a></span>
The earl of Wiltshire was not of the
number, as Sanders pretends.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_326" id="Ref_326" href="#Foot_326">[326]</a></span>
The duke of Norfolk,
the personal enemy of the unfortunate queen, that uncle
who hated her as much as he should have loved her,
had been appointed to select the judges and to preside
over the trial: a circumstance indicative of the spirit
in which it was to be conducted. Norfolk took his
seat, having the lord-chancellor on his right and the
duke of Suffolk on his left, and in front of him sat as
deputy-marshal the earl of Surrey, Norfolk's son, an
upright man, but a proud and warm supporter of
Romanism. The queen was announced: she was
received in deep silence. Before her went the governor
of the Tower, behind her came Lady Kingston and
Lady Boleyn. Anne advanced with dignity, adorned
with the ensigns of royalty, and, after gracefully saluting
the court, took her seat in the chair accorded either to
her weakness or her rank. She had no defender; but
the modesty of her countenance, the dignity of her
manner, the peace of her conscience, which found
expression in the serenity of her look, touched even her
enemies. She appeared before the tribunal of men,
thinking only of the tribunal of God; and, relying upon
her innocence, she did not fear those whom but
yesterday she had ruled as a queen. One might have
said from the calmness and nobility of her deportment,
so assured and so majestic, that she was come, not to be
tried as a criminal, but to receive the honors due to
sovereigns. She was as firm, says a contemporary, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
an oak that fears neither the hail nor the furious blasts
of the wind.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_327" id="Ref_327" href="#Foot_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>The court ordered the indictment to be read; it
charged the queen with adultery, incest, and conspiracy
against the king's person. Anne held up her hand and
pleaded 'not guilty,' and then refuted and tore to
tatters, calmly yet forcibly, the accusations brought
against her. Having an 'excellent quick wit,' and being
a ready speaker, she did not utter a word that did not
strike home,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_328" id="Ref_328" href="#Foot_328">[328]</a></span>
though full of moderation; but the tone
of her voice, the calmness of her features, and the dignity
of her countenance, pleaded more eloquently than
her words. It was impossible to look at her or to hear
her, and not declare her innocent, says an eye-witness.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_329" id="Ref_329" href="#Foot_329">[329]</a></span>
Accordingly there was a report in the Tower, and even
in the city, that the queen had cleared herself by a
most wise and noble speech and that she would be
acquitted.</p>

<p>While Anne was speaking, the duke of Northumberland,
who had once loved her and whom Henry had
cruelly enrolled among the number of her judges, betrayed
by his uneasy movements the agitation of his
bosom. Unable to endure the frightful torment any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
longer, he rose, pretending indisposition, and hastily
left the hall before the fatal verdict was pronounced.</p>

<p>The king waited impatiently for the moment when
he could introduce Jane Seymour into Anne Boleyn's
empty apartments. Unanimity of votes was not necessary
in the House of Peers. In England, during the
sixteenth century, there was pride in the people, but
servility (with few exceptions) among the great. The
axe that had severed the head of the venerable bishop
of Rochester and of the ex-chancellor More, had taught
a fearful lesson to all who might be disposed to resist
the despotic desires of the prince. The court feared to
confront the queen with the musician, the only witness
against her, and declared her guilty without other
formality. The incomprehensible facility with which
the nobility were then accustomed to submit to the
inflexible will of the monarch, could leave no room for
doubt as to the catastrophe by which this tragedy
would be terminated.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_330" id="Ref_330" href="#Foot_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ANNE'S SENTENCE.=</p>

<p>The duke of Norfolk, as lord high-steward, pronounced
sentence: that the queen should be taken
back to the Tower, and there on the green should be
burnt or beheaded, <i>according to his majesty's good pleasure</i>.
The court, desirous of leaving a little space for
Henry's compassion, left the mode of death to him: he
might do the queen the favor of being only decapitated.</p>

<p>Anne heard this infamous doom with calmness.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_331" id="Ref_331" href="#Foot_331">[331]</a></span>
No
change was observed in her features: the consciousness
of innocence upheld her heart. Clasping her
hand and raising her eyes to heaven, she cried out,
'O Father, O Creator! Thou who art the way, the
truth, and the life, knowest that I have not deserved
this death!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_332" id="Ref_332" href="#Foot_332">[332]</a></span>
Then, turning to her cruel uncle and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
the other lords, she said: 'My lords, I do not say
that my opinion ought to be preferred to your judgment;
but if you have reasons to justify it, they must
be other than those which have been produced in
court, for I am wholly innocent of all the matters
of which I have been accused, so that I cannot call
upon God to pardon me. I have always been faithful
to the king my lord; but perhaps I have not always
shown to him such a perfect humility and reverence
as his graciousness and courtesy deserved, and the
honor he hath done me required. I confess that I
have often had jealous fancies against him which I
had not wisdom or strength enough to repress. But
God knows that I have not otherwise trespassed
against him. Do not think I say this in the hope of
prolonging my life, for He who saveth from death has
taught me how to die, and will strengthen my faith.
Think not, however, that I am so bewildered in mind
that I do not care to vindicate my innocence. I knew
that it would avail me little to defend it at the last
moment, if I had not maintained it all my life long,
as much as ever queen did. Still the last words of
my mouth shall justify my honor. As for my brother
and the other gentlemen who are unjustly condemned,
I would willingly die to save them; but as that is not
the king's pleasure, I shall accompany them in death.
And then afterwards I shall live in eternal peace and
joy without end, where I will pray to God for the king—and
for you, my lords.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_333" id="Ref_333" href="#Foot_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>The wisdom and eloquence of this speech, aided by the
queen's beauty and the touching expression of her
voice, moved even her enemies. But Norfolk, determined
upon carrying out his hateful task, ordered her
to lay aside her royal insignia. She did so, and commending
herself to all their prayers, returned to her
prison.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Rocheford now came forward and took his sister's
place. He was calm and firm, and answered every
question point by point, with much clearness and
decision. But it was useless for him to affirm the
queen's innocence—useless to declare that he had
always respected her as a sister, as an 'honored lady:'
he was condemned to be beheaded and quartered.</p>

<p>The court then broke up, and while the courtiers,
who had just sealed with the blood of an innocent
queen their servile submission to the most formidable
of despots, were returning to their amusements and
base flatteries, the Lord Mayor turned to a friend and
said to him: 'I can only observe one thing in this
trial—the fixed resolution to get rid of the queen at
any price.' And that is the verdict of posterity.</p>

<p class="side">=LORD ROCHEFORD BEHEADED.=</p>

<p>The wretches who had entered into this iniquitous
plot were eager to have it ended. On the 17th of May
the gentlemen who were to be executed were brought
together into a hall of the Tower. They embraced,
commended each other to God, and prepared to depart.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_334" id="Ref_334" href="#Foot_334">[334]</a></span>
The constable of the Tower, fearing that they would
speak upon the scaffold, reminded them that the honor
due to the king would not permit them to doubt the
justice of their sentence. When they reached the place
of punishment, Lord Rocheford, no longer able to keep
silence, turned towards the spectators and said: 'My
friends, I am going to die, as such is his majesty's
pleasure. I do not complain of my death, for I have
committed many sins during my life, but <i>I have never
injured the king</i>. May God grant him a long and happy
life!' Then, according to the chronicler, he presented
his head</p>

<p class="center small">Au dur tranchant qui d'un coup l'emporta.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_335" id="Ref_335" href="#Foot_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p class="nodent">Norris, Weston, and Brereton were beheaded after him.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></div>

<p>The king, before putting his wife to death, desired
to perform an act not less cruel: he was determined
to annul his marriage with Anne, notwithstanding
Northumberland's denials. Did he wish to avoid the
reproach of causing his wife to perish by the hands of
the executioner? or, in a fit of anger, did he desire to
strike the queen on all sides at once? We cannot tell.
Be that as it may, the king in his wrath did not see that
he was contradicting himself; that if there was no marriage
between him and Anne, there could be no adultery,
and that the sentence, based on this crime, was <i>ex facto</i>
null. Cranmer, the most unfortunate, but perhaps not
the least guilty of all the lords who lent themselves
servilely to the despotic wishes of the prince—Cranmer
believed (as it appears) that the position of the queen
would thus become better; that her life would be saved,
if she could no longer be regarded as having been
Henry's wife. This excuses, although slightly, his great
weakness. He told the unhappy lady that he was
commissioned to find the means of declaring null and
void the ties which united her to the king. Anne,
stunned by the sentence pronounced upon her, was also
of opinion that it was an expedient invented by some
relics of Henry's regard, to rescue her from the bitterness
of death. Her heart opened to hope, and imagining
that she would only be sent into banishment, she formed
a plan of returning to the continent. 'I will go to Antwerp,'
she said at dinner, with an almost happy look.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_336" id="Ref_336" href="#Foot_336">[336]</a></span>
She knew that she would meet with protestants in that
city, who would receive her with joy. But vain hope!
In the very letter wherein the governor of the Tower
reports this ingenuous remark of the queen, he asks for
the king's orders as to the construction of the scaffold.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_337" id="Ref_337" href="#Foot_337">[337]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
Henry desired personally to order the arrangement of
those planks which he was about to stain with innocent
blood.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock in the forenoon of the 17th of
May the lord-chancellor, the duke of Suffolk, the earl of
Essex (Cromwell), the earl of Sussex, with several
doctors and archdeacons entered the chapel at Lambeth.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_338" id="Ref_338" href="#Foot_338">[338]</a></span>
The archbishop having taken his seat, and the
objections made against the marriage of Henry VIII.
and Anne Boleyn having been read, the proctors of the
king and of the queen admitted them, and the primate
declared the marriage to be null and void. The queen
was not present, as some historians have thought.</p>

<p class="side">=DELIGHT OF THE POPE.=</p>

<p>On the very day of Anne Boleyn's divorce, Da Casale,
the English envoy at Rome, having heard of the queen's
imprisonment, hurried to the pontifical palace to inform
Paul III. of the good news.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_339" id="Ref_339" href="#Foot_339">[339]</a></span>
'I have never ceased
praying to heaven for this favor,' said the pope with
delight, 'and I have always hoped for it. Now his
majesty may accomplish an admirable work for the
good of Christendom. Let the king become reconciled
with Rome, and he will obtain from the king of France
all that he can wish for. Let us be friends. I will
send him a nuncio for that purpose. When the news
of cardinal Fisher's death reached Rome,' he continued,
recollecting that terrible bull, 'it is true I found myself
driven to a measure somewhat severe ... but I
never intended to follow up my words by deeds.'
Thus, according to the pope and his adherents, the
imprisonment of Anne Boleyn was to reconcile England
and Rome. This fact points to one of the causes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
which made Norfolk and other catholics enter into the
conspiracy against her.</p>

<p>On the same day also (17th of May), towards evening,
the queen learnt that the sentence would assuredly be
carried out. Although it was declared that she had
never been the king's wife, the doom pronounced upon
her for adultery must nevertheless be accomplished.
This is what Henry VIII. called administering justice.</p>

<p class="side">=ANNE ASKS MARY'S PARDON.=</p>

<p>Anne desired to take the Lord's Supper, and asked
to be left alone. About two hours after midnight the
chaplain arrived; but, before partaking of the holy rite,
there was one thing she wished to do. One fault
weighed heavily on her heart. She felt that she had
sinned against queen Catherine by consenting to marry
the king. Her conscience reproached her with having
injured the princess Mary. It filled her with the
deepest sorrow, and she was eager, before she died, to
make reparation to the daughter of the woman whose
place she had taken. Anne would have liked to see
Mary, to fall a queen at her feet, and implore her
pardon; but alas! she could not: she was only to leave
the prison for the scaffold. Resolved, however, to
confess her fault, she did so in a striking manner, which
showed all the sincerity of her repentance and her firm
determination to humble herself before Catherine's
daughter. She begged Lady Kingston, the wife of the
constable of the Tower, who had little regard for her,
to take her seat in the chair of state. When the latter
objected, Anne compelled her, and kneeling before her,
she said, all the while crying bitterly: 'I charge you—as
you would answer before God—to go in my name to
the princess Mary, to fall down before her as I do now
before you, and ask her forgiveness for all the wrongs I
have done her. Until that is done,' she added, 'my
conscience will have no rest.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_340" id="Ref_340" href="#Foot_340">[340]</a></span>
At the moment when
she was about to appear before the throne of God, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
wished to make reparation for a fault that weighed
heavily upon her heart. 'In that,' she said, 'I wish to
do what a Christian ought.' This touching incident
leads us to hope that if, during life, Anne was simply
an honest protestant, trusting too much to her own
works, the trial had borne fruit and had made her a
true Christian. But of this she was to give a still more
striking proof.</p>

<p>As she rose from her knees, Anne felt more calm and
prepared to receive the sacrament. Before taking it,
she once more declared her innocence of the crime imputed
to her. The governor was present, and he did
not fail to inform Cromwell of this declaration, made as
it were in the presence of God. Anne had found in
Christ's death new strength to endure her own: she
sighed after the moment that would put an end to her
sorrows. Contrary to her expectation, she was told that
the execution was put off until the afternoon. 'Mr.
Kingston,' she said, 'I hear that I am not to die this
afternoon, and I am very sorry for it; for I thought by
this time to be dead and past my pain.'—'Madam,' replied
the governor, 'you will feel no pain, the blow will
be so sharp and swift.'—'Yes,' resumed Anne, 'I have
heard say that the headsman is very clever,' and then
she added: 'and I have but a little neck,' putting her
hand about it and smiling.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_341" id="Ref_341" href="#Foot_341">[341]</a></span>
Kingston left the room.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the devout adherents of the Roman primacy
were full of exultation, and allowed the hopes to
appear which Anne's death raised in their bosoms. 'Sire,'
they told the king, 'the tapers placed round the tomb
of queen Catherine suddenly burst into flame of their
own accord.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_342" id="Ref_342" href="#Foot_342">[342]</a></span>
They concluded, from this prodigy, that
Roman-catholicism was once more about to shed its light
on England. The priests were eager to chant their <i>Deo
gratias</i>, and a report was circulated that this new victory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
over the Reformation was going to be inaugurated by
hanging a group of heretics along with Anne.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_343" id="Ref_343" href="#Foot_343">[343]</a></span>
Neither
friends nor enemies drew any real distinction between
the cause of Anne and the cause of protestantism; and
many evangelical Christians, imagining that when Anne
was dead there would be no one to protect them any
longer, prepared to quit the kingdom.</p>

<p>Henry, however, keenly desiring to have if it were
but one word from Anne that would exculpate him, sent
some one to her with a commission to sound her, and
to discover whether the hope of escaping death would
not induce her to satisfy him. Anne replied, and they
were the last words she addressed to the king: 'Commend
me to his majesty, and tell him that he has ever
been constant in his career of advancing me. From a
private gentlewoman he made me a marchioness, from a
marchioness a queen; and now that he has no higher
degree of honor left, he gives my innocence the crown of
martyrdom.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_344" id="Ref_344" href="#Foot_344">[344]</a></span>
The gentleman went and reported this
noble farewell to his master. Even the jailer bore testimony
to the peace and joy which filled Anne Boleyn's
heart at this solemn moment. 'I have seen men and
also women executed,' wrote Kingston to Cromwell,
'and they have been in great sorrow; but to my knowledge
this lady has much joy and pleasure in death.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_345" id="Ref_345" href="#Foot_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ANNE'S EXECUTION.=</p>

<p>Everything was arranged so that the murder should
be perpetrated without publicity and without disturbance.
Kingston received orders to turn all strangers
out of the Tower, and readily obeyed. About eleven in
the forenoon of the 19th of May, the dukes of Suffolk
and Richmond, the lord-chancellor, Cromwell, the lord-mayor
with the sheriffs and aldermen, entered the
Tower, and took their stations on the green, where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
instrument of punishment had been erected. The executioner,
whom Henry had summoned from Calais, was
there with his axe and his attendants. A cannon,
mounted on the walls, was to announce both to king
and people that all was over. A little past noon Anne
appeared, dressed in a robe of black damask, and attended
by four of her maids of honor. She walked up
to the block on which she was to lay her head. Her
step was firm, her looks calm; all indicated the most
complete resignation. She was then thirty years old,
and 'never had she looked so beautiful before,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_346" id="Ref_346" href="#Foot_346">[346]</a></span>
says a
French contemporary, then in London. Her eyes expressed
a meek submission; a pleasing smile accompanied
the look she turned on the spectators of this
tragic scene.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_347" id="Ref_347" href="#Foot_347">[347]</a></span>
But just when the executioners had
made the last preparations, her emotion was so keen
that she nearly fainted. Gradually she recovered her
strength, and her faith in the Saviour filled her with
courage and hope.</p>

<p>It is important to know what, in this last and solemn
moment, were her sentiments towards the king. She
had desired that Mary should be asked to forgive her
wrongs: it was her duty, if she died a Christian, also
to pardon Henry's faults. She must obey her Saviour,
who said: '<i>Love your enemies, bless them that curse you</i>.'
She had pardoned everything; but it was her duty to
declare it before she died, and if she was humble, she
would do so without affectation. Addressing those who
had been her subjects and were then standing round
her, she said: 'Good Christian people, I am not come
here to justify myself; I leave my justification entirely
to Christ, in whom I put my trust. I will accuse no
man, nor speak anything of that whereof I am accused,
as I know full well that aught that I could say in my defence
doth not appertain unto you, and that I could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
draw no hope of life from the same. I come here only
to die, according as I have been condemned. I commend
my judges to the Lord's mercy. I pray God (and
I beg you to do the same) to save the king and send
him long to reign over you, for a gentler or more merciful
prince there never was. To me he was ever a good,
gentle, and sovereign lord. And thus I take my leave
of the world and of you, and I heartily desire you all
to pray for me. O Lord, have mercy upon me! To
God I commit my soul!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_348" id="Ref_348" href="#Foot_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>Such are the simple words in which Anne gave
utterance to the feelings of peace with which her heart
was filled towards her husband, at the moment when he
was robbing her of life. Had she said that she forgave
him, she would have called up the memory of the king's
crime, and would thus have appeared to claim the merit
of her generous pardon. She did nothing of the sort.
During one part of their wedded life, Henry had been a
'good lord' to her. She desired to recall the good only,
and buried the evil in oblivion. She did so without
any thought of self; for she knew that before the gracious
words could reach the king's ears, the axe would
have already fallen upon her, and it would be impossible
for Henry to arrest the fatal blow.</p>

<p>This Christian discourse could not fail to make a deep
impression on all who heard her. As they looked at the
unfortunate queen, they felt the tenderest compassion
and the sharpest pain.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_349" id="Ref_349" href="#Foot_349">[349]</a></span>
The firmer her heart became,
the weaker grew the spectators of the tragedy. Ere
long they were unable to check the tears which the sufferer
had the strength to restrain.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_350" id="Ref_350" href="#Foot_350">[350]</a></span>
One of the ladies
of the royal victim approached her to cover her eyes;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
but Anne refused, saying that she was not afraid of
death, and gave her as a memorial of that hour, a little
manuscript prayer-book that she had brought with her.</p>

<p>The queen then removed her white collar and took off
her hood, that the action of the axe might not be impeded;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_351" id="Ref_351" href="#Foot_351">[351]</a></span>
this head-dress formed a queue and hung down
behind. Then falling on her knees, she remained a few
moments silent and motionless, praying inwardly. On
rising up, she approached the fatal block, and laid her
head on it: 'O Christ, into thy hands I commit my
soul!' she exclaimed. The headsman, disturbed by the
mild expression of her face, hesitated a few seconds, but
his courage returned. Anne cried out again: 'O Jesus,
receive my soul!' At this instant the axe of the executioner
flashed in the air and her head fell. A cry escaped
from the lips of the spectators, 'as if they had received
the blow upon their own necks.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_352" id="Ref_352" href="#Foot_352">[352]</a></span>
This is honorable to
Anne's enemies, so that we may well believe the evidence.
But immediately another sound was heard: the gunner,
placed as a signal-man on the wall, had watched the
different phases of the scene, holding a lighted match
in his hand; scarcely had the head fallen, when he
fired the gun, and the report, which was heard at a
distance, bore to Henry the news of the crime which
gave him Jane Seymour.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_353" id="Ref_353" href="#Foot_353">[353]</a></span>
The ladies of queen Anne,
though almost lifeless with terror, would not permit the
noble remains of the mistress, whom they had loved so
much, to be touched by rude hands; they gathered
round the body, wrapped it in a white sheet, and carried
it (almost fainting as they were) to an old elm chest,
which had been brought out of the arsenal and had
been used for storing arrows. This rough box was the
last home assigned to her who had inhabited costly
palaces: not so much as a coffin had been provided for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
her. The ladies placed in it Anne's head and body;
'the eyes and lips were observed to move,' says a document,
as if her mouth was repeating the last words it
had uttered. She was immediately buried in the Tower
chapel.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_354" id="Ref_354" href="#Foot_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus died Anne Boleyn. If the violent passions of a
prince and the meanness of his courtiers brought her
to an untimely death, hatred and credulity have killed
her a second time. But an infamous calumny, forged
by dishonest individuals, ought to be sternly rejected
by all sensible men. Not in vain did Anne, at the hour
of death, place her cause in the hands of God, and we
willingly believe that all enlightened men, without prejudice
or partiality, among Roman-catholics as among
others, turn with disgust from the vile falsehoods of
malicious courtiers and the deceitful fables of the papist
Sanders and his followers.</p>

<p class="side">=HENRY'S INHUMANITY.=</p>

<p>On the morning of this day, Henry VIII. had dressed
himself in white, as for a festival, and ordered a hunting-party.
There was a great stir round the palace;
huntsmen hurrying to and fro, dogs baying, horns sounding,
nobles arriving. The troop was formed and they
all set off for Epping Forest, where the sport began.
At noon the hunters met to repose themselves under an
oak which still bears the name of the <i>King's Oak</i>.
Henry had taken his seat beneath it, surrounded by his
suite and the dogs; he listened and seemed to be
agitated. Suddenly a cannon shot resounded through
the forest—it was the concerted signal—the queen's
head had fallen. 'Ha, ha!' exclaimed the king, rising,
'the deed is done! uncouple the hounds and away.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_355" id="Ref_355" href="#Foot_355">[355]</a></span>
Horns and trumpets were sounded, and dogs and horses
were soon in pursuit. The wretched prince, led away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
by his passions, forgot that there is a God to whom he
would have to render an account not only of the execution
in the Tower, but of the chase in the forest; and
by these cruel acts, which should have shocked the
hearts even of his courtiers, he branded himself with
his own hands as a great criminal. The king and his
court returned to the palace before nightfall.</p>

<p>At last Henry was free. He had desired Jane Seymour,
and everything had been invented—adultery,
incest—to break the bonds that united him to the
queen. The proofs of Anne's crimes failing, the ferocious
acts of the king were to supply their place.
Could those who witnessed the cruelty of the husband
venture to doubt the guilt of the wife? Henry had
become inhuman that he might not appear faithless.
Now that the object was obtained, it only remained to
profit by his crime. His impatience to gratify his passions
made him brave all propriety. The mournful
death of his queen; the Christian words that she had
uttered, kissing as it were the cruel hand that struck
her—nothing softened that man's heart, and the very
next day he married the youthful maid of honor. It
would have been difficult to say in a more striking
manner: 'This is why Anne Boleyn is no more!'
When we see side by side the blood-stained block on
which Anne had received her death-blow, and the brilliant
altar before which Henry and Jane were united,
we all understand the story.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_356" id="Ref_356" href="#Foot_356">[356]</a></span>
The prince, at once
voluptuous and cruel, liked to combine the most contrary
objects in the same picture—crime and festivities,
marriage and death, sensuality and hatred. He showed
himself the most magnificent and most civilized monarch
of Europe; but also the rival of those barbarous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
kings of savage hordes who take delight in cutting off
the heads of those who have been their favorites and
even the objects of their most passionate love. We
must employ different standards in judging of the same
person, when we regard him as a private and as a public
individual. The Tudor prince, so guilty as a husband,
father, and friend, did much good as a ruler for England.
Louis XIV., as well as Henry VIII., had some
of the characteristics of a great king; and his moral
life was certainly not better than that of his prototype
in England. He had as many, and even more mistresses
than the predecessor of the Stuarts had wives;
but the only advantage which the French monarch had
over the English one, is that he knew how to get rid of
them without cutting off their heads.</p>

<p>The death of Anne Boleyn caused a great sensation in
Europe, as that of Fisher and More had done before it.
Her innocence, which Henry (it is said) acknowledged
on his death-bed,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_357" id="Ref_357" href="#Foot_357">[357]</a></span>
was denied by some and maintained
by others; but all men of principle expressed a feeling
of horror when they heard of her punishment. The
protestant princes and divines of Germany had not a
doubt that this cruel act was the pledge of reconciliation
offered to the pope by Henry VIII., and renounced the
alliance they were on the point of concluding with England.
'At last I am free from that journey,' said Melanchthon,
whom Anne Boleyn's death, added to that of
Sir Thomas More, had rendered even less desirous of
approaching the prince who had struck them. 'The
queen,' he continued, 'accused, rather than convicted,
of adultery, has suffered the penalty of death, and that
catastrophe has wrought great changes in our plans.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_358" id="Ref_358" href="#Foot_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></div>

<p>Somewhat later the protestants ascribed Anne's death
especially to the pope: 'That blow came from Rome,'
they cried; 'in Rome all these tricks and plots are contrived.
Even Petrarch had long since called that city</p>

<div class="small left2">Nido di tradimenti, in cui si cuova</div>
<div class="small left2">Quanto mal per lo mondo hoggi si spande.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_359" id="Ref_359" href="#Foot_359">[359]</a></span></div>

<p>In this I suspect there is a mistake. The plots of the
Roman court against Elizabeth have caused it to be accused
of similar designs against the mother of the great
protestant queen. The friends of that court in England
were probably no strangers to the crime, but the great
criminal was Henry.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XI.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">REFORMING MOVEMENT AFTER ANNE'S DEATH; CATHOLIC AND SCHOLASTIC REACTION.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Summer, 1536.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="side">=POSITION OF THE TWO PARTIES.=</p>

<p><span class="smc">After</span> queen Anne's death the two parties were agitated
in opposite directions. The friends of the Reformation
wished to show that the disgrace of that
princess did not carry with it the disgrace of the cause
they had at heart, and consequently believed that they
ought to accelerate the Reform movement. The friends
of Rome and its doctrines, imagining, on their part, that
the queen's death had put their affairs in good train,
thought they had but to redouble their activity to gain
a complete victory. The latter seemed indeed to have
some reasons for encouragement. If Catherine's death
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
had reconciled Henry VIII. and the emperor just when
the latter was threatening England with invasion, the
death of Anne Boleyn appeared as if it would reconcile
the king with Paul III., who was ready to issue his terrible
bull. Henry's wives played a great part in his private
history, but they had also a certain importance in
his relations with the powers of Europe, especially with
the pope. As soon as the pontiff had seen Charles V.
and Francis I. preparing for war, he had instructed his
<i>son</i> to hint to Da Casale, that the court of Rome was
very desirous of reviving the ancient friendship which
had united it to England.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_360" id="Ref_360" href="#Foot_360">[360]</a></span>
These desires increased
rapidly.</p>

<p>On the 20th of May, when the news of the queen's
prosecution arrived in Rome, both pope and cardinals
were transported with joy. The frightful calumnies of
which that princess was the victim, served the cause of
the papacy too well not to be accepted as truths, and
all felt persuaded that, if Anne fell from the throne, the
acts done at London against the Italian primacy would
fall with her. When Da Casale informed the pope that
the queen had been sent to prison, Paul exclaimed with
delight: 'I always thought, when I saw Henry endowed
with <i>so many virtues</i>, that heaven would not forsake him.
If he is willing to unite with me,' he added, 'I shall have
authority enough to enjoin the emperor and the king of
France to make peace; and the king of England, reconciled
with the Church, will command the powers of
Europe.' At the same time Paul III. confessed that
he had made a mistake in raising Fisher to the cardinalate,
and wound up this pontifical effusion in the kindest
of terms. Da Casale, much delighted on his part,
asked whether he was to repeat these matters to the
king. 'Tell him,' answered the pope, 'that his majesty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
may, without hesitation, expect everything from me.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_361" id="Ref_361" href="#Foot_361">[361]</a></span>
Da Casale, therefore, made his report to London, and
intimated that, if Henry made the least sign of reconciliation,
the pope would immediately send him a nuncio.
Thus Paul left not a stone unturned to win over the
king of England. He extolled his virtues, promised
him the foremost place in Europe, flattered his vanity
as an author, and did not fear—he the infallible one—to
acknowledge that he had made a mistake. Everybody
at the court of Rome felt convinced that England
was about to return to the bosom of the Church; cardinal
Campeggi even sent his brother to London to
resume possession of the bishopric of Salisbury, of which
he had been deprived in 1534.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_362" id="Ref_362" href="#Foot_362">[362]</a></span>
Up to the end of June,
the pope and the cardinals became kinder and more
respectful to the English, and entertained the most flattering
expectations regarding the return of England.</p>

<p class="side">=THE TWO HENRYS.=</p>

<p>Would these expectations be realized? Henry VIII.
was not one man, but two: his domestic passions and
his public acts formed two departments entirely distinct.
Guided as an individual by passion, he was, as a king,
sometimes led by just views. He believed that neither
pope nor foreign monarch had a right to exercise the
smallest jurisdiction in England. He was therefore decided—and
this saved Great Britain—to maintain the
rupture with Rome. One circumstance might have
taught him that in all respects it was the best thing he
could do.</p>

<p>Rome has two modes of bringing back princes under
her yoke—flattery and abuse. The pope had adopted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
the first: a person, at that time without influence, Reginald
Pole, an Englishman, and also a relative and
<i>protégé</i> of Henry's, undertook the second. In 1535 he
was in the north of Italy; burning with love for the
papacy and hatred for the king, his benefactor, he wrote
<i>ab irato</i> a defence of the unity of the Church, addressed
to Henry VIII., and overflowing with violence. The
wise and pious Contarini, to whom he showed it, begged
him to soften a tone that might cause much harm. As
Pole refused, Contarini entreated him at least to submit
his manuscript to the pope; but the young Englishman,
fearing that Paul would require him to suppress the untoward
publication, declined acceding to his friend's
request. His object was, not to convert the king, but
to stir up the English against their lawful prince, and
induce them to fall prostrate again before the Roman
pontiff. The treatise, finished in the winter of 1536,
before Anne's trial, reached London the first week in
June. Tonstall, bishop of Durham, and Pole's friend,
read the book, which contained a few truths mixed up
with great errors, and then communicated it to the king.
Never did haughty monarch receive so rude a lesson.</p>

<p class="side">=POLE'S APPEAL TO THE KING.=</p>

<p>'Shall I write to you, O prince,' said the young Englishman,
'or shall I not? Observing in you the certain
symptoms of the most dangerous malady, and assured
as I am that I possess the remedies suitable to cure you,
how can I refrain from pronouncing the word which
alone can preserve your life? I love you, sire, as son
never loved his father, and God perhaps will make my
voice to be like that of his own Son, <i>whose voice even the
dead hear</i>. O prince, you are dealing the most deadly
blow against the Church that it can possibly receive,
you rob it of the chief whom it possesses upon earth.
Why should a king, who is the supreme head of the
State, occupy a similar place in the Church? If we
may trust the arguments of your doctors, we must conclude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
that Nero was the head of the Church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_363" id="Ref_363" href="#Foot_363">[363]</a></span>
We
should laugh, if the laughter were not to be followed by
tears. There is as great a distance between the ecclesiastical
and the civil power, as there is between heaven
and earth. There are three estates in human society:
first, the people; then the king, who is the son of the
people; and lastly, the priest, who being the <i>spouse of
the people</i> is consequently the <i>father of the king</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_364" id="Ref_364" href="#Foot_364">[364]</a></span>
But
you, in imitation of the pride of Lucifer, set yourself
above the vicar of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>'What! you have rent the Church, as it was never before
rent in that island, you have plundered and cruelly
tormented it, and you claim, in virtue of such merits, to
be called its supreme head. There are two Churches: if
you are at the head of one, it is not the Church of Christ;
if you are, it is like Satan, who is the prince of the world,
which he oppresses under his tyranny.... You reign,
but after the fashion of the Turks. A simple nod of
your head has more power than ancient laws and rights.
Sword in hand you decide religious controversies. Is
not that thoroughly Turkish and barbarian?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_365" id="Ref_365" href="#Foot_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>'O England! if you have not forgotten your ancient
liberty, what indignation ought to possess you, when
you see your king plunder, condemn, murder, squander
all your wealth, and leave you nothing but tears.
Beware, for if you let your grievances be heard, you will
be afflicted with still deeper wounds. O my country! it
is in your power to change your great sorrow into
greater joy. Neither Nero nor Domitian, nor—I dare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
affirm—Luther himself, if he had been king of England,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_366" id="Ref_366" href="#Foot_366">[366]</a></span>
would have wished to avenge himself by putting to death
such men as Fisher and Sir Thomas More!</p>

<p>'What king has ever given more numerous signs of respect
to the supreme pontiff than that Francis I. who
spoke of you, O Henry, in words received with applause
by the whole Christian world: "your friend,—till the
altar," <i>Amicus—usque ad aras</i>.—The emperor Charles
has just subdued the pirates; but is there any pirate
that is worse than you? Have you not plundered the
wealth of the Church, thrown the bodies of the saints
into prison, and reduced men's souls to slavery? If I
heard that the emperor with all his fleet was sailing for
Constantinople, I would fall at his feet, and say—were
it even in the straits of the Hellespont—"O emperor,
what are you thinking of? Do you not see that a much
greater danger than the Turks threatens the Christian
republic? Change your route. What would be the use
of expelling the Turks from Europe, when new Turks
are hatched among us?" Certainly the English for
slighter causes have forced their kings to put off their
crowns.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_367" id="Ref_367" href="#Foot_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>After the apostrophe addressed to Charles V., Reginald
Pole returns to Henry VIII., and imagining himself
to be the prophet Elijah before king Ahab, he says with
great boldness: 'O king, the Lord hath commanded me
to curse you; but if you will patiently listen to me, he
will return you good for evil. Why delay to confess
your sin? Do not say that you have done everything
according to the rules of Holy Scripture. Does not the
Church, which gives it authority, know what is to be received
and what rejected? You have forsaken the
fountain of wisdom. Return to the Church, O prince!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
and all that you have lost you shall regain with more
splendor and glory.</p>

<p>'But if anyone hears the sound of the trumpet and
does not heed it, the sword is drawn from the scabbard,
the guilty is smitten, and his blood is upon his own
head.'</p>

<p class="side">=ITS EFFECT ON HENRY.=</p>

<p>We have hardly given the flower of this long tirade,
written in the style of the 16th century, which, divided
into four books, fills one hundred and ninety-two folio
pages. It reached England at the moment of the condemnation
of the innocent Anne, which Pole unconsciously
protested against as unjust, more unjust even
than the sentences of Fisher and More. Henry did
not at first read his 'pupil's' philippic through. He
saw enough, however, to regard it as an insult, a divorce
which Italy had sent him. He ordered Pole to return
to England; but the latter remembered too well the
fate of Fisher and Sir Thomas More to run the risk.
Bishop Tonstall, one of the enemies of the Reformation,
wrote, however, to Pole, that as Christ was the head of
the Church, to separate it from the pope was not to
separate from its head. This refutation was short but
complete.</p>

<p>The king was resolved to maintain his independence
of the pope. Some have ascribed this determination to
Pole's treatise, and others to the influence of Jane Seymour.
Both these circumstances may have had some
weight in Henry's mind; but the great cause, we repeat,
is that he would not suffer any master but himself
in England. Gardiner replied to Pole in a treatise
which he entitled: <i>On True Obedience</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_368" id="Ref_368" href="#Foot_368">[368]</a></span>
to which Bonner
wrote the preface.</p>

<p>Paul III. was not the only one who descried the
signal of triumph in Anne's death: the princess Mary
believed that she would now become heiress-presumptive
to the crown. Lady Kingston, having discharged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
Anne Boleyn's Christian commission, Catherine's
daughter, but slightly affected by this touching conduct,
took advantage of it for her own interest, and charged
that lady with a letter addressed to Cromwell, in which
she begged him to intercede for her with the king, so
that the rank which belonged to her should be restored.
Henry consented to receive his daughter into favor, but
not without conditions: 'Madam,' said Norfolk, who
had been sent to her by the king, 'here are the articles
which require your signature.'</p>

<p>The daughter of the proud Catherine of Aragon was
to acknowledge four points: the supremacy of the king,
the imposture of the pope, the incest of her own mother,
and her own illegitimacy. She refused, but as Norfolk
was not to be shaken, she signed the two first articles;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_369" id="Ref_369" href="#Foot_369">[369]</a></span>
then laying down the pen, she exclaimed: 'As for my
own shame and my mother's—never!' Cromwell
threatened her, called her obstinate and unnatural, and
told her that her father would abandon her: the unhappy
princess signed everything. She was restored to
favor, and from that time received yearly three thousand
pounds sterling; but she was deceived in thinking
that the misfortune of her little sister Elizabeth would
replace her on the steps of the throne.</p>

<p class="side">=THANKS OF PARLIAMENT.=</p>

<p>Parliament met on the 8th of June, when the chancellor
announced to them that the king, notwithstanding
his mishaps in matrimony, <i>had yielded to the humble
solicitations of the nobility</i>, and formed a new union. The
two houses ratified the accomplished facts. No man desired
to stir the ashes from which sparks might issue
and kindle a great conflagration. At no price would
they compromise the most exalted persons in the kingdom,
and especially the king. All the allegations, even
the most absurd, were admitted: Parliament wanted to
have done with the matter. It even went further: the
king was thanked for the <i>most excellent goodness</i> which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
had induced him to marry a lady whose brilliant youth,
remarkable beauty, and purity of blood were the sure
pledges of the happy issue which a marriage with her
could not fail to produce; and his most respectful subjects
determined to bury the faults of their prince under
flowers, compared him for beauty to Absalom, for
strength to Samson, and for wisdom to Solomon. Parliament
added, that as the daughters of Catherine and
Anne were both illegitimate, the succession had devolved
upon the children of Jane Seymour. As, however, it
was possible that she might not have any issue, parliament
granted him the privilege of naming his successor
in his will: an enormous prerogative, conferred upon
the most capricious of monarchs. Those who refused to
take the oath required by the statute were to be declared
guilty of high treason.</p>

<p>Parliament having thus arranged the king's business,
set about the business of the country. 'My lords,' said
ministers on the 4th of July to the upper house, 'the
bishop of Rome, whom some persons call <i>pope</i>, wishing
to have the means of satisfying his love of luxury and
tyranny, has obscured the Word of God, excluded Jesus
Christ from the soul, banished princes from their kingdoms,
monopolized the mind, body, and goods of all
Christians, and, in particular, extorted great sums of
money from England by his dreams and superstitions.'
Parliament decided that the penalties of <i>præmunire</i>
should be inflicted on everybody who recognized the
authority of the Roman pontiff, and that every student,
ecclesiastic, and civil functionary should be bound to renounce
the pope in an oath made in the name of God
and all his saints.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_370" id="Ref_370" href="#Foot_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>This bill was the cause of great joy in England; the
protestant spirit was stirred; there was a great outburst
of sarcasms, and one could see that the citizens of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
capital naturally were not friends to the papacy. Man
is inclined to laugh at what he has respected when he
finds that he has been deceived, and then readily classes
among human follies what he had once taken for the
wisdom of Heaven. A contest of epigrams was begun
in London, similar to that which had so often taken
place at Rome between Pasquin and Marforio: perhaps,
however, the jokes were occasionally a little heavy.
'Do you see the stole round the priest's neck?' said one
wit; 'it is nothing else but the bishop of Rome's rope.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_371" id="Ref_371" href="#Foot_371">[371]</a></span>—'Matins,
masses, and evensong are nothing but a
roaring, howling, whistling, murmuring, tomring, and
juggling.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_372" id="Ref_372" href="#Foot_372">[372]</a></span>—'It
is as lawful to christen a child in a tub
of water at home or in a ditch by the way, as in a font-stone
in the church.'—Gradually this jesting spirit made
its way to the lower classes of society.—'Holy water is
very useful,' said one who haunted the London taverns;
'for as it is already salted, you have only to put an
onion in it to make sauce for a gibbet of mutton.'—'What
is that you say,' replied some blacksmith, 'it is a
very good medicine for a horse with a galled back.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_373" id="Ref_373" href="#Foot_373">[373]</a></span>
But while frivolity and a desire to show one's wit, however
coarse it might be, gave birth to silly jests merely
provocative of laughter, the love of truth inspired the
evangelical Christians with serious words which irritated
the priests more than the raillery of the jesters. 'The
Church,' they said, 'is not the clergy, the Church is the
congregation of good men only. All ceremonies accustomed
in the Church and not clearly expressed in Scripture
ought to be done away. When the sinner is converted,
all the sins over which he sheds tears are remitted
freely by the Father who is in heaven.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_374" id="Ref_374" href="#Foot_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>After the words of the profane and of the pious came
the words of the priests. A convocation of the clergy
was summoned to meet at St. Paul's. The bishops came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
and took their places, and anyone might count the votes
which Rome and the Reformation had on the episcopal
bench. For the latter there were: archbishop Cranmer;
Goodrich, bishop of Ely; Shaxton, bishop of Salisbury;
Fox, bishop of Hereford; Latimer, bishop of Worcester;
Hilsey, bishop of Rochester; Barlow, bishop of St.
David's; Warton, bishop of St. Asaph; and Sampson,
bishop of Chichester—nine votes in all. For Rome
there were: Lee, archbishop of York; Stokesley, bishop
of London; Tonstall, bishop of Durham; Longland,
bishop of Lincoln; Vesey, bishop of Exeter; Clerk,
bishop of Bath; Lee, bishop of Lichfield; Salcot, bishop
of Bangor; and Rugge, bishop of Norwich—nine against
nine. If Gardiner had not been in France there would
have been a majority against the Reformation. Forty
priors and mitred abbots, members of the upper house,
seemed to assure victory to the partisan of tradition.
The clergy, who assembled under their respective banners,
were divided not by shades but by glaring colors,
and people asked, as they looked on this chequered
group, which of the colors would carry the day.
Cranmer had taken precautions that they should not
leave the church without being enlightened on that
point.</p>

<p class="side">=LATIMER'S SERMON.=</p>

<p>The bishop of London having sung the mass of the
Holy Ghost, Latimer, who had been selected by the
primate to edify the assembly, went up into the pulpit.
Being a man of bold and independent character, and
penetrating, practical mind, which could discover and
point out every subterfuge, he wanted a Reform more
complete even than Cranmer desired. He took for his
text the parable of the unjust steward.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_375" id="Ref_375" href="#Foot_375">[375]</a></span>
'Dear
brethren,' he said, 'you have come here to-day to hear
of great and weighty matters. Ye look, I am assured,
to hear of me such things as shall be meet for this
assembly.' Then having introduced his subject, Latimer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
continued: 'A faithful steward coineth no new money,
but taketh it ready coined of the good man of the house.
Now, what crowds of our bishops, abbots, prelates, and
curates, despising the money of the Lord as copper and
not current, teach that now redemption purchased by
money and devised by men is of efficacy, and not redemption
purchased by Christ.'</p>

<p>The whole of Latimer's sermon was in this strain.
He did not stop here; in the afternoon he preached
again. 'You know the proverb,' he said—'"An evil
crow, an evil egg."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_376" id="Ref_376" href="#Foot_376">[376]</a></span>
The devil has begotten the world,
and the world in its turn has many children. There is
my Lady Pride, Dame Gluttony, Mistress Avarice, Lady
Lechery, and others, that now hard and scant ye may
find any corner, any kind of life, where many of his
children be not. In court, in cowls, in cloisters, yea,
where shall ye not find them? Howbeit, they that be
secular are not children of the world, nor they that are
called spiritual, of the clergy. No, no; as ye find
among the laity many children of light, so among the
clergy ye shall find many children of the world. They
do execrate and detest the world (being nevertheless
their father) in words and outward signs; but in heart
and works they coll and kiss him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_377" id="Ref_377" href="#Foot_377">[377]</a></span>
They show themselves
to be as sober as Curius the Roman was,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_378" id="Ref_378" href="#Foot_378">[378]</a></span>
and
live every day as if all their life were a shroving time (a
carnival). I see many such among the bishops, abbots,
priors, archdeacons, deans, and others of that sort, who
are met together in this convocation, to take into consideration
all that concerns the glory of Christ and the
wealth of the people of England. The world has sent
us some of its whelps.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_379" id="Ref_379" href="#Foot_379">[379]</a></span>
What have you been doing
these seven years and more? Show us what the English
have gained by your long and great assemblies. Have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
they become even a hair's breadth better? In God's
name, what have you done?—so great fathers, so many, so
long a season, so oft assembled together—what have you
done? Two things: the one, that you have burnt a dead
man (William Tracy); the other, that ye went about to
burn one being alive.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_380" id="Ref_380" href="#Foot_380">[380]</a></span>
Ye have oft sat in consultation,
but what have ye done? Ye have had many things in
deliberation, but what one is put forth whereby either
Christ is more glorified, or else Christ's people made
more holy? I appeal to your own conscience.'</p>

<p>Here Latimer began, as Luther had done in his
<i>Appeal to the German Nobility</i>, to pass in review the
abuses and errors of the clergy—the Court of Arches,
the episcopal consistories, saints' days, images, vows,
pilgrimages, certain vigils which he called 'bacchanalia,'
marriage, baptism, the mass, and relics.</p>

<p>After this severe catalogue, the bishop exclaimed:
'Let us go home even as good as we came hither, right-begotten
children of the world. Let us beat our
fellows, let us eat and drink with drunkards. But God
will come, God will come, yea and he will not tarry.
He will come upon such a day as we nothing look for
him. He will come and cut us in pieces, and let be the
end of our tragedy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_381" id="Ref_381" href="#Foot_381">[381]</a></span>
These be the delicate dishes prepared
for the world's well-beloved children. These be
the wafers and junkets provided for worldly prelates—wailing
and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>'If you will not die eternally, live not worldly.
Preach truly the Word of God. Feed ye tenderly the
flock of Christ. Love the light. Walk in the light, and
so be the children of light while you are in the world,
that you may shine in the world to come bright as the
sun, with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
Amen.'</p>

<p>An action full of simplicity and warmth had accompanied
the firm and courageous words of the Reformer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
The reverend members of convocation had found their
man, and his sermon appeared to them bitterer than
wormwood. They dared not, however, show their
anger, for behind Latimer was Cranmer, and they feared
lest they should find the king behind Cranmer.</p>

<p>Ere long the clergy received another mortification
which they dared not complain of. A rumor got abroad
that Cromwell would be the representative of Henry VIII.
in the assembly. 'What!' they cried out, 'a layman,
a man who has never taken a degree in any
university!' But what was the astonishment of the
prelates, when they saw not Cromwell enter, but his
secretary, Dr. Petre, one of the convent visitors, whom
the primate seated by his side—a delegate of a delegate!
On the 21st of June, Cromwell came down, and took his
seat above all the prelates. The lay element took, with
a bold step, a position from which it had been so long
banished.</p>

<p class="side">=THE MALA DOGMATA DENOUNCED.=</p>

<p>It was to be expected that the champions of the
middle ages would not submit to such affronts, and
particularly to such a terrible fire as Latimer's, without
unmasking their batteries in return, and striving to
dismantle those of the enemy. They saw that they
could not maintain the supremacy of the pope and
attack that of the king; but they knew that Henry
adhered to transubstantiation and other superstitious
doctrines of the dark ages; and accordingly they determined
to attack by this breach, not only Latimer,
but all the supporters of the Reformation. Roman-catholicism
did not intend to perish without a struggle;
it resolved—in order that it might hold its ground in
England—to make a vigorous onslaught. The lower
house having chosen for its prolocutor one Richard
Gwent, archdeacon of bishop Stokesley and a zealous
ultramontanist, the cabal set to work, and the words of
Wycliff, of the Lollards, of the Reformers, and even of
the jesting citizens having been carefully recorded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
Gwent proposed that the lower house should lay before
the upper house sixty-seven evil doctrines (<i>mala dogmata</i>).
Nothing was forgotten, not even <i>the horse with
the galled back</i>. To no purpose were they reminded
that what was blamable in this catalogue were only
'the indiscreet expressions of illiterate persons;' and
that the rudeness of their imagination alone had caused
them to utter these pointed sarcasms. In vain were they
reminded that, even in horse races, the riders to be sure
of reaching their goal pass beyond it. The enumeration
of the <i>mala dogmata</i> was carried, without omitting a
single article.</p>

<p>On the 23d of June, the prolocutor appeared with
his long list before the upper house of convocation.
'There are certain errors,' he said, 'which cause disturbance
in the kingdom,' and then he read the sixty-seven
<i>mala dogmata</i>. 'They affirm,' he continued, 'that
no doctrine must be believed unless it be proved by
Holy Scripture; that Christ, having shed his blood, has
fully redeemed us, so that now we have only to say, O
God, I entreat Thy Majesty to blot out my iniquity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_382" id="Ref_382" href="#Foot_382">[382]</a></span>
They say that the sacrifice of the mass is nothing but a
piece of bread; that auricular confession was invented
by the priests to learn the secrets of the heart, and to
put money in their purse; that purgatory is a cheat;
that what is usually called the Church is merely the old
synagogue, and that the true Church is the assembly of
the just; that prayer is just as effectual in the open air
as in a temple; that priests may marry. And these
heresies are not only preached, but are printed in books
stamped <i>cum privilegio</i>, with privilege, and the ignorant
imagine that those words indicate the king's approbation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_383" id="Ref_383" href="#Foot_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>The two armies stood face to face, and the scholastic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
party had no sooner read their lengthy manifesto than
the combat began. 'Oh, what tugging was here between
these opposite sides,' says honest Fuller.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_384" id="Ref_384" href="#Foot_384">[384]</a></span>
They
separated without coming to any decision. Men began
to discuss which side they should take: 'Neither one
nor the other,' said those who fancied themselves the
cleverest. 'When two stout and sturdy travellers meet
together and both desire the way, yet neither is willing
to fight for it, in their passage they so shove and
shoulder one another, that they divide the way between
them, and yet neither gets the same.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_385" id="Ref_385" href="#Foot_385">[385]</a></span>
The two parties
in convocation ought to do the same: there ought to be
neither conquerors nor conquered.' Thus the Church,
<i>the pillar of truth</i>, was required to admit both black and
white—to say Yes and No. 'A medley religion,'
exclaims an historian; 'to salve (if not the consciences)
at least the credits of both sides.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_386" id="Ref_386" href="#Foot_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ALESIUS IN CONVOCATION.=</p>

<p>Cranmer and Cromwell determined to use the opportunity
to make the balance incline to the evangelical
side. They went down to convocation. While passing
along the street Cromwell noticed a stranger—one
Alesius, a Scotchman, who had been compelled to seek
refuge in Germany for having professed the pure
Gospel, and there he had formed a close intimacy with
Melanchthon. Cranmer, as well as Cromwell, desirous
of having such an evangelical man in England—one
who was in perfect harmony with the Protestants of
Germany, and whose native tongue was English—had
invited him over to London.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_387" id="Ref_387" href="#Foot_387">[387]</a></span>
Melanchthon had given
him a letter for the king, along with which he sent a
copy of his commentary on the Epistle to the Romans.
Henry was so charmed with the Scotchman, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
gave him the title of 'King's Scholar.' Alesius was
living at the archbishop's palace in Lambeth. Cromwell,
observing him so seasonably, called him and
invited him to accompany them to Westminster. He
thought that a man of such power might be useful to
him; and it is even possible that the meeting had been
prearranged. Together the Englishman and the
Scotchman entered the chamber in which the bishops
were sitting round a table, with a number of priests
standing behind them. When the vicar-general and
Alesius, who was unknown to most of them, appeared,
they all rose and bowed to the king's representative.
Cromwell returned the salutation, and, after seating the
exile in the highest place opposite the two archbishops,
he addressed them as follows: 'His majesty will not
rest until, in harmony with convocation and parliament,
he has put an end to the controversies which have
taken place, not only in this kingdom but in every
country. Discuss these questions, therefore, with
charity, without brawling or scolding, and decide all
things by the Word of God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_388" id="Ref_388" href="#Foot_388">[388]</a></span>
Establish the divine and
perfect truth as it is found in Scripture.'</p>

<p class="side">=GOD'S WORD THE SOURCE OF LIFE.=</p>

<p>Cromwell wanted the submission of <i>all</i> to the divine
revelations: the traditional party answered him by
putting forward human doctrines and human authorities.
Stokesley, bishop of London, endeavored to prove, by
certain glosses and passages, that there were seven sacraments:
the archbishop of York and others supported
him by their sophistry and their shouts. 'Such disputes
about words, and such cries,' said Cranmer, 'are unbecoming
serious men. Let us seek Christ's glory, the
peace of the Church, and the means by which sins are
forgiven. Let us inquire how we may bring consolation
to uneasy souls; how we may give the assurance of
God's love to consciences troubled by the remembrance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
of their sins. Let us acknowledge that it is not the
outward use of the sacraments that justifies a man, and
that our justification proceeds solely from faith in the
Saviour.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_389" id="Ref_389" href="#Foot_389">[389]</a></span>
The prelate spoke admirably and in accordance
with Scripture: it was necessary to back up this
noble confession. Cromwell, who kept his Scotchman
in reserve, now introduced him to the clergy, as the
'king's scholar,' and asked him what he thought of the
discussion. Alesius, speaking in the assembly of bishops,
showed that there were only <i>two</i> sacraments—Baptism
and the Lord's Supper, and that no ceremony ought to
be put in the same rank with them. The bishop of
London chafed with anger in his seat. Shall a mere
Scotchman, driven from his country and entertained by
German protestants, presume to teach the prelates of
England? He shouted out indignantly, 'All that is
false!' Alesius declared himself ready to prove what
he had said out of Scripture and the old fathers. Then
Fox, bishop of Hereford, who had just returned from
Wittemberg, whither he had been sent by the king, and
where he had been enlightened by conversing with
Luther and Melanchthon, rose up and uttered these
noble sentiments: 'Christ hath so lightened the world
at this time,' he said, 'that the light of the Gospel hath
put to flight all misty darkness; and the world will no
longer endure to be led astray by all that fantastic rubbish
with which the priests formerly filled their imaginations
and their sermons.' This was pointed at bishop
Stokesley and his friends: 'It is vain to resist the Lord;
his hand drives away the clouds. The laity know the
Holy Scriptures now better than many of us.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_390" id="Ref_390" href="#Foot_390">[390]</a></span>
The
Germans have made the text of the Bible so easy, by
the Hebrew and Greek tongue, that even women and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
children wonder at the blindness and falsehood that
hath been hitherto. Consider that you make not yourselves
to be laughed to scorn of all the world. If you
resist the voice of God, you will give cause for belief
that there is not one spark of learning or godliness in
you. All things consist not in painted eloquence and
strength of authority. For truth is of so great power,
strength, and efficacy, that it can neither be defended
with words nor be overcome with any strength; but
after she hath hidden herself long, at length she pusheth
up her head and appeareth.' Such was the eloquent
and Christian language with which even bishops endeavored
to bring about the triumph of that English Reformation
which some have been pleased to represent as
'the product of an amorous caprice.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_391" id="Ref_391" href="#Foot_391">[391]</a></span>
Moved by such
Christian remarks, Alesius exclaimed, 'Yes, it is the
Word of God that bringeth life; the Word of God is
the very substance and body of the Sacrament. It
makes us certain and sure of the will of God to save our
souls: the outward ceremony is but a token of that
lively inflammation which we receive through faith in
the Word and promise of the Lord.' At these words
the bishop of London could not contain himself. 'The
Word of God,' he cried; 'Yes, granted! But you are
far deceived if you think there is no <i>other</i> Word of God
but that which every souter and cobbler may read in
his mother-tongue.' Stokesley believed in another
Word of God besides the Bible; he thought, as the
council of Trent did a little later, 'That we must receive
<i>with similar respect and equal piety the Holy Scriptures
and</i> <span class="smc">Tradition</span>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_392" id="Ref_392" href="#Foot_392">[392]</a></span>
As it was noon, Cromwell broke up
the meeting.</p>

<p>The debate had been sharp. The sacerdotal, sacramental,
ritualist party had been beaten; the evangelicals
desired to secure their victory.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span></p>

<p>Alesius, after his return to Lambeth, began to compose
a treatise; Stokesley, on the other hand, prepared to
get up a conspiracy against Alesius. Next day the
bishops, who arrived first at Westminster, entered into
conversation about the last sitting, and were very indignant
that a stranger, a Scotchman, should have been
allowed to sit and speak among them. Stokesley called
upon Cranmer to resist such an irregularity. The archbishop,
who was always rather weak, consented, and
Cromwell entering shortly after with his protégé, an
archdeacon went up to the latter and told him that his
presence was disagreeable to the bishops. 'It is better
to give way,' said Cromwell to Alesius; 'I do not want
to expose you to the hatred of the prelates. When once
they take a dislike to a man, they never rest until they
have got him out of the way. They have already put to
death many Christians for whom the king felt great
esteem.' Alesius withdrew and the debate opened.
'Are there seven sacraments or only two?' was the
question. It was impossible to come to an understanding.</p>

<p>Convocation, an old clerical body, in which were
assembled the most resolute partisans of the abuses,
superstitions, and doctrines of the middle ages, was the
real stronghold of Rome in England. To undertake to
introduce the light and life of the Gospel into it was a
rash and impracticable enterprise. The divine Head of
the Church himself has declared that '<i>no man putteth new
cloth to an old garment, neither do men put new wine into
old bottles</i>.' There was but one thing to be done. Suppress
the assembly and form a new one, composed of
members and ministers of the Church, who acknowledge
no other foundation, no other rule, than the Word of
God. '<i>New wine must be put into new bottles.</i>' Such a
step as this would have helped powerfully to reform the
Church of England really and completely. But it was
not taken.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">A MOVEMENT OF SCHOLASTIC CATHOLICISM INAUGURATED BY
 THE KING. EVANGELICAL REACTION.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Autumn, 1536.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">After</span> Anne Boleyn's death, the men of the Reformation
had taken the initiative, and Cranmer, Cromwell,
Latimer, and Alesius seemed on the point of winning
the prize of the contest. The intervention of a greater
personage was about to turn the medal.</p>

<p class="side">=HENRY PLAYS THE POPE.=</p>

<p>Anne's disgrace and the wedding with Jane Seymour
had occupied the king with far other matters
than theology. Cranmer had the field free to advance
the Reformation. This was not what Henry meant;
and as soon as he noticed it, he roused himself, as if
from slumber, and hastened to put things in order.
Though rejecting the authority of the pope, he remained
faithful to his doctrines. He proceeded to act
in his character as head of the Church, and resolved
to fulminate a bull, as the pontiffs had done. Reginald
Pole, in the book which he had addressed to
him, observed that in matters touching the pope, we
must not regard either his character or his life, but
only his authority; and that the lapses of a pope in
morals detract nothing from his infallibility in faith.
Henry understood this distinction very clearly, and
showed himself a pope in every way. He did not believe
that there was any incompatibility between the
right he claimed of taking a new wife whenever he
pleased, by means of divorce or the scaffold, and that of
declaring the oracles of God on contrition, justification,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
and ecclesiastical rites and ceremonies. The rupture of
the negotiations with the protestants gave him more
liberty, and even caused him a little vexation. His
chagrin was not unmingled with anger, and he was
not grieved to show those obstinate Germans what
they gained by not accepting him. In this respect
Henry was like a woman who, annoyed at being rejected
by the man she prefers, gives her hand to his
rival in bravado. He returned, therefore, to his theological
labors. The doctors of the scholastic party
spared him the pains of drawing up for himself the
required articles; but he revised them and was elated
at the importance of his work. 'We have in our own
person taken great pain, study, labors, and travails,'
he said, 'over certain articles which will establish concord
in our Church.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_393" id="Ref_393" href="#Foot_393">[393]</a></span>
Cromwell, always submissive to
his master and well knowing the cost of resistance,
laid this royal labor before the upper house of Convocation.
In religious matters Henry had never done
anything so important. The doctrine of the authority
of the prince over the dogmas of the Church now became
a <i>fact</i>. The king's dogmatic paper, entitled <i>Articles
about religion set out by the Convocation, and published
by the King's authority</i>, bears a strong resemblance to
the <i>Exposition</i> and the <i>Type of Faith</i>, published in the
seventh century, during the monothelite controversy,
by the emperors of Constantinople—Heraclius and
Constant II. That prince, who in a political sense
gave England a new impulse, sought his models as
an ecclesiastical ruler, in the Lower Empire. Everybody
was eager to know what doctrines the new head
of the Church was going to proclaim. The partisans
of Rome were doubtless quite as much surprised as
the Reformers, but their astonishment was that of
joy; the surprise of the evangelicals was that of fear.
The vicar-general read the royal oracles aloud: 'All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
the words contained in the whole canon of the Bible.'
he said, 'and in the three creeds—the Apostles', the
Nicene, and the Athanasian—<i>according to the interpretation
which the holy approved doctors in the Church do defend</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_394" id="Ref_394" href="#Foot_394">[394]</a></span>
shall be received and observed as the infallible
words of God, so that whosoever rejects them is not
a member of Christ but a member of the devil, and
eternally damned.'</p>

<p class="side">=ARTICLES OF RELIGION.=</p>

<p>That was the Romish doctrine, and Bossuet, in his
examination of the royal document, appears much satisfied
with the article.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_395" id="Ref_395" href="#Foot_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>'The sacrament of baptism should be administered
to infants, in order that they may receive the Holy
Ghost and be purified of sin by its secret virtue and
operation. If a man falls after baptism the sacrament
of penance is necessary to his salvation; he must go to
confession, ask absolution at the priest's hands, and
look upon the words uttered by the confessor as the
<i>voice of God</i> speaking out of heaven.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_396" id="Ref_396" href="#Foot_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="squash">—</span>—'That is the whole substance of the catholic
doctrine,' the partisans of Rome might urge.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_397" id="Ref_397" href="#Foot_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>'Under the form of the bread and the wine are verily,
substantially, and really contained the body and very
blood of the Saviour which was born of the Virgin.'</p>

<p><span class="squash">—</span>—'That indicates most precisely the real presence
of the body,' say the Romish doctors.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_398" id="Ref_398" href="#Foot_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>'The merits of the Saviour's passion are the only and
worthy causes of our justification; but, before giving it
to us, God requires of us inward contrition, perfect
faith, hope, and charity, and all the other spiritual
motions which must necessarily concur in the remission
of our sins.'</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></div>

<p><span class="squash">—</span>—The council of Trent declared the same doctrine
not long after.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_399" id="Ref_399" href="#Foot_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>'Images ought to be preserved in the churches.
Only let those who kneel before them and adore them
know that such honor is not paid to the images, but to
God.'</p>

<p><span class="squash">—</span>—'To use such language,' Roman-catholics have
said, 'is to approve of image-worship to the extreme.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_400" id="Ref_400" href="#Foot_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>'It is praiseworthy,' continued Cromwell, 'to address
prayers to our Blessed Lady, to St. John the Baptist,
to each of the apostles, or to any other saint, in order
that they may pray for us and with us; but without
believing there is more mercy in them than in Christ.'</p>

<p><span class="squash">—</span>—'If the king looks upon this as a kind of Reformation,'
said a Romish doctor, 'he is only making
game of the world; for no catholic addresses the saints
except to have their prayers.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_401" id="Ref_401" href="#Foot_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>'As for the ceremonies, such as sprinkling with holy
water, distributing the consecrated bread, prostration
before the cross and kissing it, exorcisms, &amp;c., these
rites and others equally praiseworthy ought to be maintained
as putting us in remembrance of spiritual things.'</p>

<p><span class="squash">—</span>—'That is precisely our idea,' said the partisans of
Romish tradition.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_402" id="Ref_402" href="#Foot_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>'Finally, as to purgatory, the people shall be taught
that Christians ought to pray for the souls of the dead,
and give alms, in order that others may pray for them,
so that their souls may be relieved of some part of their
pain.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_403" id="Ref_403" href="#Foot_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="squash">—</span>—'All that we teach is here approved of,' said the
great opponent of protestantism.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_404" id="Ref_404" href="#Foot_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the religion which the prince, whom some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
writers call the father of the Reformation, desired to
establish in England. If England became protestant,
it was certainly in spite of him.</p>

<p class="side">=THE ARTICLES ACCEPTED.=</p>

<p>A long debate ensued in convocation and elsewhere.
The decided evangelicals could see nothing in these
articles but an abandonment of Scripture, a 'political
daubing,' in which the object was only to please certain
persons and to attain certain ends. The men of the
moderate party said, on the other hand, 'Ought we not
to rejoice that the Scriptures and ancient creeds are
re-established as rules of faith, without considering the
pope?' But above these opposite opinions rose the
terrible voice of the king: <i>Sic volo, sic jubeo</i>: Such is
my pleasure, such are my orders. If the primate and
his friends resisted, they would be set aside and the
Reformation lost.</p>

<p>It does not appear that Cranmer had any share in
drawing up these articles, but he signed them. It has
been said, to excuse him, that neither he, nor many of his
colleagues, had at that time a distinct knowledge of such
matters, and that they intended to make amendments
in the articles; but these allegations are insufficient.
Two facts alone explain the concessions of this pious
man: the king's despotic will and the archbishop's
characteristic weakness. He always bent his head;
but, we must also acknowledge, it was in order to raise
it again. Archbishop Lee, sixteen bishops, forty abbots
or priors, and fifty archdeacons or proctors signed after
Cromwell and the primate. The articles passed through
Convocation, because—like Anne's condemnation—<i>it was
the king's will</i>. Nothing can better explain the concessions
of Cranmer, Cromwell, and others in the case
of Anne Boleyn, than their support of these articles,
which were precisely the opposite of the Scriptural
doctrine whose triumph they had at heart. In both
cases they had yielded slavishly to those magic words:
<i>Le roi le veut</i>, The king wills it. Those four words were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
sufficient: that man was <i>loyal</i> who sacrificed his own
will to the sovereign. It was only by degrees that the
free principles of protestantism were to penetrate among
the people, and give England liberty along with order.
Still that excuse is not sufficient: Cranmer would have
left a more glorious name if he had suffered martyrdom
under Henry VIII., and not waited for the reign of
Mary.</p>

<p>When the king's articles were known, discontent
broke out in the opposite parties. 'Be silent, you contentious
preachers and you factious schoolmen,' said the
politicians: 'you would sooner disturb the peace of the
world, than relinquish or retract one particle!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_405" id="Ref_405" href="#Foot_405">[405]</a></span>
The
articles were sent all over England, with orders that
everyone should conform to them at his peril.</p>

<p>Cranmer did not look upon the game as lost. To
bend before the blast, and then rise up again and guide
the Reform to a good end, was his system. He first
strove to prevent the evil by suggesting measures calculated
to remedy it. Convocation resolved that a
petition should be addressed to the king, praying him
to permit his lay subjects to read the Bible in <i>English</i>,
and to order a new translation of it to be made;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_406" id="Ref_406" href="#Foot_406">[406]</a></span>
moreover,
a great number of feast-days were abolished as
favoring 'sloth, idleness, thieves, excesses, vagabonds,
and riots;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_407" id="Ref_407" href="#Foot_407">[407]</a></span>
and finally, on the last day of the session
(20th of July), Convocation declared—to show clearly
that there was no question of returning to popery—that
there was nothing more pernicious than a general
council;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_408" id="Ref_408" href="#Foot_408">[408]</a></span>
and that, consequently, they must decline to
attend that which the pope intended to hold in the city
of Mantua. Thereupon parliament and Convocation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
were dissolved, and the king did without them for three
years.</p>

<p class="side">=CROMWELL'S INSTRUCTIONS.=</p>

<p>Henry VIII. was satisfied with his minister. Cromwell
was created Lord Privy-Seal, the 2d of July, 1536,
baron, and a few days later vicegerent in ecclesiastical
matters (<i>in rebus ecclesiasticis</i>). Wishing to tone down
what savored too much of the schools in the king's
articles, he circulated among all the priests some instructions
which were passably evangelical. 'I enjoin
you,' he said, 'to make your parishioners understand
that they do rather apply themselves to the keeping of
God's commandments and fulfilling of his works of
charity, and providing for their families, than if they
went about to pilgrimages.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_409" id="Ref_409" href="#Foot_409">[409]</a></span>
Advise parents and
masters to teach their children and their servants the
Lord's Prayer, the Apostles' Creed, and the Ten Commandments,
in their mother-tongue.' He even undertook
to reform the clergy. 'Deans, parsons, vicars,
curates, and priests,' he said, 'are forbidden to haunt
taverns, to drink or brawl after dinner or supper, to
play at cards day or night. If they have any leisure,
they should read the Scriptures, or occupy themselves
with some honest exercise.'</p>

<p>Cranmer and Cromwell went farther than this. They
wished to circulate the Holy Scriptures. Tyndale's
version was, in Cromwell's opinion, too far compromised
to be officially circulated; he had, therefore, patronized
another translation. Coverdale, who was born in 1488,
at a place of that name in Yorkshire, had undertaken
(as we have seen) to translate the Bible, and had applied
to Cromwell to procure him the necessary books.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_410" id="Ref_410" href="#Foot_410">[410]</a></span>
Tyndale was more independent, a man of firmer and
bolder character than Coverdale. He did not seek the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
aid of men, and finished his work (so to say) alone with
God. Coverdale, pious no doubt like his rival, felt the
need of being supported, and said, in his letter to Cromwell,
that he implored his help, 'prostrate on the knees
of his heart.'</p>

<p>Coverdale knew Greek and Hebrew. He began his
task in 1530; on the 4th of October, 1535, the book appeared,
probably at Zurich, under the title: <span class="smc">Biblia</span>, <i>the
Bible, that is to say, the Holy Scriptures of the Old and
New Testament</i>; and reached England in the early part
of 1536. At the beginning of the volume was a dedication
to Henry VIII., which ended by imploring the
divine blessing on the king and on his 'dearest, just
wife, and most virtuous princess, queen Anne.' Cromwell
was to present this translation to the king, and circulate
it throughout the country; but this <i>dearest wife</i>,
this <i>most virtuous princess</i>, had just been accused by
Henry, dragged before the tribunals, and beheaded.
It was impossible to distribute a single copy of this version
without arousing the monarch's anger. Those who
desired that the ship which had come so far should not
be wrecked in the harbor, had recourse to several expedients.
The decapitated queen's name was <i>Anne</i>,
that of the queen-regnant was <i>Jeanne</i>: there was a resemblance
between them. Some copies corrected with
a pen have instead of <i>queen Anne</i>,—<i>queen JAne</i>; in
others the name of the queen is simply scratched out.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_411" id="Ref_411" href="#Foot_411">[411]</a></span>
These expedients were not sufficient: a new title-page
was printed and dated 1536, the current year. But it
was all of no use: it was impossible to obtain the royal
sanction.</p>

<p>Still, if Coverdale's Bible was not admitted into England,
the Reformation, taught by pious ministers, was
spreading more and more. The priests murmured in
vain: 'Not long ago,' they said, 'the Lollards were put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
to death for reading the Gospel in English, and now we
are ordered to teach it in that language. We are
robbed of our privileges, and our labors are increased.'</p>

<p class="side">=EVANGELICAL REACTION.=</p>

<p>The king had proclaimed and laid down his ten
articles to little purpose: faith gave pious ministers and
Christians a courage which the great ones of the earth
did not possess. John Gale, pastor of Twaite, in
Suffolk, a quick, decided, but rather imprudent man,
attacked the royal articles from his pulpit. But he did
not stop there. His church was ornamented with
images of the Virgin and Saints, before which the
devout used to stick up tapers. 'Austin,' said he one
day to a parishioner, 'follow me;' and the two men,
with great exertions, took away the iron rods on which
the worshippers used to set their tapers, and turned the
images to the wall.—'Listen,' said Dr. Barret to his
parishioners, 'the lifting up of the host betokens simply
that the Father has sent his Son to suffer death for
man, and the lifting up of the chalice, that <i>the Son has
shed his blood for our salvation</i>.'—'Christ,' said Bale,
prior of Dorchester, 'does not dwell in churches of
stone, but in heaven above and in the hearts of men on
earth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_412" id="Ref_412" href="#Foot_412">[412]</a></span>—The
minister of Hothfield declared that:
'Our Lady is not the queen of heaven, and has no more
power than another woman.' 'Pull him out of the
pulpit,' said the exasperated bailiff to the vicar. 'I
dare not,' answered the latter. In fact, the congregation
were delighted at hearing their minister say of
Jesus, as Peter did: <i>Neither is there salvation in any
other</i>, and that very day more than a hundred embraced
their pastor's doctrines.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_413" id="Ref_413" href="#Foot_413">[413]</a></span>
Jerome, vicar of Stepney,
endeavored to plant the pure truth of Christ in the
conscience,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_414" id="Ref_414" href="#Foot_414">[414]</a></span>
and root out all vain traditions, dreams
and fantasies. Being invited to preach at St. Paul's
Cross, on the fourth Sunday in Lent, he said: 'There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
are two sorts of people among you: the free, who are
freely justified without the penance of the law and without
meritorious works; and the slaves, who are still
under the yoke of the law.'—Even a bishop, Barlow of
St. David's, said in a stately cathedral: 'If two or
three cobblers or weavers, elect of God, meet together
in the name of the Lord, they form a true Church of
God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_415" id="Ref_415" href="#Foot_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>This was going too far: proceedings were commenced
against those who had thus braved the king's articles.
Jerome appeared before Henry VIII. at Westminster.
The poor fellow, intimidated by the royal majesty,
tremblingly acknowledged that the sacraments were
necessary for salvation; but he was burnt five years
after in the cause of the Gospel. Gale and others were
accused of heresy and treason before the criminal court.
The books were not spared. There were some, indeed,
that went beyond all bounds. One, entitled <i>The little
garden of the soul</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_416" id="Ref_416" href="#Foot_416">[416]</a></span>
contained a passage, in which the
beheading of John the Baptist and of Anne Boleyn
were ascribed to the same motive—the reproach of a
criminal love uttered against two princes: one by Anne,
and the other by John. Henry compared to Herod!
Anne Boleyn to Saint John the Baptist! Tonstall
denounced this audacious publication to Cromwell.</p>

<p>The crown-officers were to see that the doctrines of
the pope were taught everywhere; but, without the
pope and his authority, this system has no solid foundation.
The Holy Scriptures, to which evangelical Christians
appeal, is a firm foundation. The authority of the
pope—a vicious principle—at least puts those who
admit it in a position to know what they believe. But
catholicism with Romish doctrine and without the pope,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
has no ground to stand on. Non-Roman-catholicism
has but a treacherous support. Another system had
already, in the sixteenth century, set up reason as the
supreme rule; but it presents a thousand different
opinions, and no absolute truth. There is but one real
foundation: <i>Thy word is truth</i>, says Jesus Christ.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">INSURRECTION OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND<br />
 TO RESTORE THE PAPACY AND DESTROY THE REFORMATION.<br />
 (<span class="smc">October, 1536.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> bastard system of a catholicism without a pope,
put forward by the king, did not enjoy great favor, and
the evangelical Reform gained fresh adherents every
day. The more consistent popish system endeavored to
stand against it. There were still many partisans of
Rome in the aristocracy and among the populations of
the North. A mighty effort was about to be made to
expel both Cranmer's protestantism and the king's
catholicism, and restore the papacy to its privileges. A
great revolution is rarely accomplished without the
friends of the old order of things combining to resist it.</p>

<p class="side">=INFLUENCE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.=</p>

<p>Many members of the House of Lords saw with alarm
the House of Commons gaining an influence which it
had never possessed before, and taking the initiative in
reforms which were not (as they thought) within its
sphere. Trained in the hatred of heresy, those noble
lords were indignant at seeing heretics invested with the
episcopal dignity, and a layman, Cromwell, presuming
to direct the convocation of the clergy. Some of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
formed a league, and Lord Darcy, who was at their head,
had a conference on the subject with the ambassador of
Charles V. That prince assured him that he should be
supported.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_417" id="Ref_417" href="#Foot_417">[417]</a></span>
The English partisans of the pope, aided
by the imperialists, would be amply sufficient, they
thought, to re-establish the authority of the Roman
pontiff.</p>

<p>There was great agitation especially among the inhabitants
of the towns and villages of the North. Those of
the counties of York and Lincoln, too remote from
London to feel its influence, besides being ignorant and
superstitious, were submissive to the priests as to the
very representatives of God. The names of the Reformers
Luther, Melanchthon, Œcolampadius, and Tyndale
were known by the priests, who taught their flocks to
detest them. Everything they saw exasperated them.
If they went a journey, the convents which were their
ordinary hostelries existed no longer. If they worked
in the fields, they saw approaching them some ragged
monk, with tangled hair and beard, with haggard eye,
without bread to support him, or roof to shelter him, to
whom hatred still gave strength to complain and to
curse. These unhappy wretches went roaming up and
down the country, knocking at every door; the peasants
received them like saints, seated them at their table,
and starved themselves for their nourishment. 'See,'
said the friars, showing their rags to the people about
them, 'see to what a condition the members of Jesus
Christ are reduced! A schismatic and heretical prince
has expelled us from the houses of the Lord. But the
Holy Father has excommunicated and dethroned him:
no one should henceforth obey him.' Such words produced
their effect.</p>

<p>When the autumn of 1536 had arrived, the ferment
increased among the inhabitants of the rural districts
who had no longer their field labors to divert them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
They assembled in great numbers round the convents to
see what the king meant to do with them. They looked
on at a distance, and with angry eyes watched the commissioners
who at times behaved violently, indulged in
exactions, or threw down one after another the stones
of the building which had been held in such long reverence.
Another day they saw the agent of some lord
settle in the monastery with his wife, children, and
servants; they heard those profane lay-folks laugh and
chatter as they entered the sacred doors, whose thresholds
had until now been trodden only by the sandals
of the silent monks. A report spread abroad, that the
monasteries still surviving were also about to be suppressed.
Dr. Makerel, formerly prior of Barlings, disguised
as a laborer, and a monk (some writers say a
shoemaker) named Melton, who received the name of
'Captain Cobbler,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_418" id="Ref_418" href="#Foot_418">[418]</a></span>
endeavored to inflame men's minds
and drive them to revolt. Everywhere the people listened
to the agitators; and ere long the superior clergy
appeared in the line of battle. 'Neither the king's
highness nor any temporal man,' they said, 'may be
supreme head of the Church. The Pope of Rome is
Christ's vicar, and must alone be acknowledged as
supreme head of Christendom.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_419" id="Ref_419" href="#Foot_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=REVOLT IN LINCOLNSHIRE.=</p>

<p>On Monday, 2d of October, 1536, the ecclesiastical
commission was to visit the parish of Louth in Lincolnshire,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_420" id="Ref_420" href="#Foot_420">[420]</a></span>
and the clergy of the district were ordered to be
present. Only a few days before, a neighboring monastery
had been suppressed and two of Cromwell's
agents placed in it to see to the closing. The evening
before the inspection (it was a Sunday) a number of the
townspeople brought out a large silver cross which belonged
to the parish, and shouting out, 'Follow the
cross! All follow the cross! God knows if we can do so
for long,' marched in procession through the town, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
Melton leading the way. Some went to the church,
took possession of the consecrated jewels, and remained
under arms all night to guard them for fear the royal
commissioners should carry them off. On Monday
morning one of the commissioners, who had no suspicions,
quietly rode into the town, followed by a single
servant. All of a sudden the alarm-bell was rung, and
a crowd of armed men filled the streets. The terrified
commissioner ran into the church, hoping to find it an
inviolable asylum; but the mob laid hold of him,
dragged him out into the market-place, and pointing a
sword at his breast, said to him, 'Swear fidelity to the
Commons or you are a dead man.' All the town took
an oath to be faithful to King, Commons, and Holy
Church. On Tuesday morning the alarm-bell was rung
again; the cobbler and a tailor named Big Jack marched
out, followed by a crowd of men, some on foot and some
on horseback. Whole parishes, headed by their priests,
joined them and marched with the rest. The monks
prayed aloud for the pope, and cried out that if the
gentry did not join them they should all be hanged;
but gentlemen and even sheriffs united with the tumultuous
troops. Twenty thousand men of Lincolnshire
were in arms. England, like Germany, had its peasant
revolt;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_421" id="Ref_421" href="#Foot_421">[421]</a></span>
but while Luther was opposed to it, the archbishop
of York, with many abbots and priests, encouraged
it in England.</p>

<p>The insurgents did not delay proclaiming their grievances.
They declared that if the monasteries were
restored, men of mean birth dismissed from the Council,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_422" id="Ref_422" href="#Foot_422">[422]</a></span>
and heretic bishops deprived, they would acknowledge
the king as head of the Church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_423" id="Ref_423" href="#Foot_423">[423]</a></span>
The movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
was got up by the monks more than by the pope.
Great disorders were committed.</p>

<p>The court was plunged into consternation by this
revolt. The king, who had no standing army, felt his
weakness, and his anger knew no bounds. 'What!'
he said to the <i>traitors</i> (for such was the name he gave
them), 'what! do you, the rude commons of one shire,
and that one of the most <i>brute and beastly</i> of the whole
realm, presume to find fault with your king? Return
to your homes, surrender to our lieutenants a hundred
of your leaders, and prepare to submit to such condign
punishment as we shall think you worthy of; otherwise
you will expose yourselves, your wives and children, your
lands and goods, not only to the indignation of God, but
to utter destruction by force and violence of the sword.'</p>

<p>Such threats as these only served to increase the
commotion. 'Christianity is going to be abolished,'
said the priests; 'you will soon find yourselves under
the sword of <i>Turks</i>! But whoever sheds his blood
with us shall inherit eternal glory.' The people
crowded to them from all quarters. Lord Shrewsbury,
sent by the king against the rebellion, being unable
to collect more than 3,000 men, and having to contend
against ten times as many, had halted at Nottingham.
London already imagined the rebels were at its gates,
and mighty exertions were made. Sir John Russell and
the duke of Suffolk were sent forward with forces hurriedly
equipped.</p>

<p>The insurgents were 60,000 strong, but with no
efficient leader or store of provisions. Two opinions
arose among them: the gentlemen and farmers cried,
'Home, home!' the priests and the people shouted, 'To
arms!' The party of the friends of order continued
increasing, and at last prevailed. The duke of Suffolk
entered Lincolnshire on October 13, and the rebels
dispersed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_424" id="Ref_424" href="#Foot_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></div>

<p class="side">=PILGRIMAGE OF GRACE.=</p>

<p>A still greater danger threatened the established
order of things. The men of the North were more
ultramontane than those of Lincoln. On October 8
there was a riot at Beverley, in Yorkshire. A Westminster
lawyer, Robert Aske, who had passed his
vacation in field-sports, was returning to London, when
he was stopped by the rebels and proclaimed their
leader. On October 15 he marched to York and replaced
the monks in possession of their monasteries.
Lord Darcy, an old soldier of Ferdinand of Spain and
Louis XII., a warm papal partisan, quitted his castle of
Pomfret to join the insurrection. The priests stirred
up the people,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_425" id="Ref_425" href="#Foot_425">[425]</a></span>
and ere long, the army, which amounted
to 40,000 men, formed a long procession, 'the <i>Pilgrimage
of Grace</i>,' which marched through the county of York.
Each parish paraded under a captain, priests carrying
the church cross in front by way of flag. A large banner,
which floated in the midst of this multitude,
represented on one side Christ with the five wounds on
a cross, and on the other a plow, a chalice, a pix, and
a hunting-horn. Every pilgrim wore embroidered on
his sleeve the five wounds of Christ with the name of
Jesus in the midst. The insurgents had a thousand
bows and as many bills, besides other arms,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_426" id="Ref_426" href="#Foot_426">[426]</a></span>
but
hardly one poor copy of the Testament of Christ. 'Ah!'
said Latimer, preaching in Lincolnshire, 'I will tell
you what is the true Christian man's pilgrimage.
There are, the Saviour tells us, eight days' journeys.'
Then he described the eight beatitudes in the most
evangelical manner: the poor in spirit, those who
mourn, those who are meek, those who hunger and
thirst after righteousness, and the rest.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_427" id="Ref_427" href="#Foot_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>Aske's pilgrimage was of another sort. Addressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
the people of those parts, he said to them: 'Lords,
knights, masters, and friends, evil-disposed persons
have filled the king's mind with new inventions: the
holy body of the Church has been despoiled. We have
therefore undertaken this <i>pilgrimage</i> for the reformation
of what is amiss and the punishment of heretics.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_428" id="Ref_428" href="#Foot_428">[428]</a></span>
If you will not come with us we will fight and die
against you.' Great bonfires were lighted on all the
hills to call the people to arms. Wherever these new
crusaders appeared the monks were replaced in their
monasteries and the peasants constrained to join the
pilgrimage, under pain of seeing their houses pulled
down, their goods seized, and their bodies handed over
to the mercy of the captains.</p>

<p>There was this notable difference between the revolt
in Germany and that in the North of England. In
Germany, a few nobles only joined the people and were
compelled to do so. In England, almost all the nobility
of the North rallied to it of their own accord. The
earls of Westmoreland, Rutland, and Huntingdon,
Lords Latimer, Lumley, Scrope, Conyers, and the
representatives of several other great families, followed
the example of old Lord Darcy. One single nobleman,
Percy, earl of Northumberland, remained faithful to the
king. He had been ill since the unjust sentence which
had struck the loyal wife of Henry VIII.—a sentence
in which he had refused to join—and was now at his
castle lying on a bed of pain which was soon to be the
bed of death. The rebels surrounded his dwelling and
summoned him to join the insurrection. He might
now have avenged the crime committed by Henry VIII.
against Anne Boleyn, but he refused. Savage voices
shouted out, 'Cut off his head, and make Sir Thomas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
Percy earl in his stead.' But the noble and courageous
man said calmly to those around him, 'I can die but
once; let them kill me, and so put an end to my
sorrows.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_429" id="Ref_429" href="#Foot_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>The king, more alarmed at this revolt than at the
former one, asked with terror whether his people
desired to force him to replace his neck under the
detested yoke of the pope. In this crisis he displayed
great activity. Being at Windsor, he wrote letter after
letter to Cromwell.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_430" id="Ref_430" href="#Foot_430">[430]</a></span>
'I will sell all my plate,' he said.
'Go to the Tower, take as much plate as you may want,
and coin it into money.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_431" id="Ref_431" href="#Foot_431">[431]</a></span>
Henry displayed no less
intelligence than decision. He named as commander
of his little army a devoted servant, who was also the
chief of the ultramontane party at the court—the duke
of Norfolk. Once already, for the condemnation of the
protestant Anne Boleyn, Henry had selected this chief
of the Romish party. This clever policy succeeded
equally well for the king in both affairs.</p>

<p>London, Windsor, and all the south of England were
in great commotion. People imagined that the papacy,
borne on the lusty arms of the northern men, was
about to return in triumph into the capital; that perhaps
the Catholic king of the Scots, Henry's nephew,
would enter with it and place England once more
under the papal sceptre. The friends of the Gospel
were deeply agitated. 'That great captain the devil,'
said Latimer in the London pulpits, 'has all sorts of
ordnance to shoot at Christian men. These men of the
North, who wear the cross and the wounds before and
behind,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_432" id="Ref_432" href="#Foot_432">[432]</a></span>
are marching against Him who bare the cross
and suffered those wounds. They have risen (they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
say) to support the king, and they are fighting against
him. They come forward in the name of the Church,
and fight against the Church, which is the congregation
of faithful men. Let us fight with the sword of the
spirit, which is the Word of God.'</p>

<p>The rebels, far from being calmed, showed—part of
them at least—that they were animated by the vilest
sentiments. A body of insurgents had invested the
castle of Skipton, the only place in the county of York
which still held for the king. The wife and daughters
of Lord Clifford, and other ladies who inhabited it,
happened to be at an abbey not far off, just when the
castle was beleaguered. The insurgents caused Lord
Clifford to be informed that if he did not surrender, his
wife and daughters would be brought next day to the
foot of the walls and be given up to the camp-followers.
In the middle of the night, Christopher Aske, brother
of Robert, who had remained faithful, crept through the
camp of the besiegers, and by unfrequented roads succeeded
in bringing into the castle all those ladies, whom
he thus saved from the most infamous outrages.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_433" id="Ref_433" href="#Foot_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE LANCASTER HERALD.=</p>

<p>Robert Aske, Lord Darcy, the archbishop of York,
and several other leaders had their head-quarters at
Pomfret castle, where the Lancaster herald, dispatched
by the king, presented himself on the 21st of October.
After passing through many troops of armed men—'very
cruel fellows,' he says<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_434" id="Ref_434" href="#Foot_434">[434]</a></span>—he
was at last introduced
to the great captain. Seeing Lord Darcy and the archbishop
before him—persons more important than the
Westminster lawyer—the herald began to address them.
Aske was offended, and rising from his seat told him
haughtily, that he was the person to be addressed. The
messenger discharged his mission. He represented to
the leaders of the rebellion that they were but a handful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
before the great power of his Majesty,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_435" id="Ref_435" href="#Foot_435">[435]</a></span>
and that the
king had done nothing in regard to religion, but what
the clergy of York and of Canterbury had acknowledged
to be in conformity with the Word of God. When the
speech was ended, Aske, as if he did not care for the
herald's words, said rudely to him, 'Show me your
proclamation.' 'He behaved,' wrote the envoy, 'as
though he had been some great prince, with great rigor
and like a tyrant.' 'Herald,' said Aske, 'this proclamation
shall neither be read at the market-cross nor elsewhere
amongst my people. We want the redress of our
grievances, and we will die fighting to obtain them.'
The herald asked what were their grievances. 'My
followers and I,' replied the chief, 'will walk in pilgrimage
to London, to his Majesty, to expel from the council
all the vile blood in it, and set up all the noble blood
again;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_436" id="Ref_436" href="#Foot_436">[436]</a></span>
and also to obtain the full restitution of Christ's
Church.' 'Will you give me that in writing?' said the
herald. Aske gave him the oath which the rebels took,
and at the same time putting his hand on the paper, he
said with a loud voice, 'This is my act; I will die in its
defence, and all my followers will die with me.' The
herald, intimidated by the authoritative tone of the
chief, bent his knee before the rebel captain, for which
he was brought to trial and executed in the following
year. 'Give him a guard of forty men, and see him out
of town,' said Aske.</p>

<p class="side">=REBELS MARCH ON LONDON.=</p>

<p>Forthwith thirty thousand well-armed men, of whom
twelve thousand were mounted, set out under the orders
of Aske, Lord Darcy, and other noblemen of the
country. Norfolk had only a small force, which he
could not trust; accordingly the rebels were convinced,
that when they appeared, the king's soldiers and perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
the duke himself would join them. The Roman-catholic
army arrived on the banks of the Don, on the other side
of which (at Doncaster) the king's forces were stationed.
Those ardent men, who were six against one, inflamed
by monks who were impatient to return to their nests,
proposed to pass the Don, overthrow Norfolk, enter
London, dictate to the king the execution of all the
partisans of the Reformation, and restore the papal
power in England. The rising of the water, increased
by heavy rains, did not permit them to cross the river.
Every hour's delay was a gain to the royal cause; the
insurgents having brought no provisions with them,
were forced to disband to go in search of them elsewhere.
Norfolk took advantage of this to circulate an
address among the rebels. 'Unhappy men!' it said,
'what folly hath led you to make this most shameful rebellion
against our most righteous king, who hath kept
you in peace against all your enemies? Fye, for shame!
How can you do this to one who loves you more than
all his subjects? If you do not return, every man to
his house, we will show you the hardest courtesy that
ever was shown to men, that have loved you so well as
we have done. But if you go to your homes, you shall
have us most humble suitors to his Highness for you.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_437" id="Ref_437" href="#Foot_437">[437]</a></span>
This proclamation was signed by Lords Norfolk, Shrewsbury,
Exeter, Rutland, and Huntingdon, all catholics,
and the greatest names in England.</p>

<p>The insurgents thus found themselves in the most
difficult position. They must attack the supporters of
their own cause. If the lords who had signed the proclamation
were slain, England would lose her best councillors,
and her greatest generals, and the Church would
be deprived of the most zealous catholics. The strength
of England would be sacrificed and the country opened
to her enemies. Old Lord Darcy was for attacking;
young Robert Aske for negotiation. On Saturday, 28th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
of October, commissioners from both parties met on the
bridge leading to Doncaster. The rebel commissioners
consented to lay down their arms, provided the heresies
of Luther, Wicliff, Huss, Melanchthon, Œcolampadius,
and the works of Tyndale were destroyed and nullified;
that the supremacy was restored to the see of Rome;
that the suppressed abbeys were re-established; that
heretical bishops and lords were punished by fire or
otherwise; and that a parliament was held promptly at
Nottingham or York.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_438" id="Ref_438" href="#Foot_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>There could no longer be any doubt, that the object
of the insurrection was to crush the Reformation. The
names of most of the reformers were mentioned in the
articles, and fire or sword were to do justice to the most
illustrious of their adherents. The same evening they
handed in a letter addressed: <i>To the King's Royal Highness.
From Doncaster, this Saturday, at eleven of the clock
at night. Haste, post, haste, haste, haste!</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_439" id="Ref_439" href="#Foot_439">[439]</a></span>
The rebels
themselves were in such haste that they waited no
longer. The next day (29th of October) the king's
lieutenant announced at one in the afternoon, that the
insurgents had dispersed and were returning to their
homes.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_440" id="Ref_440" href="#Foot_440">[440]</a></span>
Two of the rebel leaders were to carry the
stipulated conditions to the king, and Norfolk was to
accompany them. That zealous catholic was not perhaps
without a hope that the petition would induce
Henry to become reconciled to the pope. He was
greatly deceived.</p>

<p>Thus God had scattered the forces of those who
had stood up against Wicliff, Huss, and Luther. The
kingdom resumed its usual tranquillity. A little later
the men of the North, excited by the intrigues of the
pope and Reginald Pole, then a cardinal, again took
up arms; but they were defeated; seventy of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
were hanged on the walls of Carlisle, and Lords Darcy
and Hussey, with many barons, abbots, priors, and a
great number of priests, were executed in different
places. The scheming archbishop of York alone escaped,
it is not known how. The cottages, parsonages,
and castles of the North were filled with anguish and
terror. Henry, who cut off the heads of his most intimate
friends and of his queen, did not think of sparing
rebels. It was a terrible lesson, but not very effectual.
The priests did not lose their courage; they still kept
asking for the re-establishment of the pope, the death of
the Lutherans, and the annihilation of the Reform. An
event which occurred at this time seemed likely to favor
their desires. A great blow was about to be dealt
against the Reformation. But the ways of God are not
as our ways, and from what seems destined to compromise
His cause, He often makes His triumph proceed.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE DEATH OF THE GREAT REFORMER OF ENGLAND.<br />
 (<span class="smc">From 1535 to October 1536.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">Most</span> of the reformers, Luther, Zuingle, Calvin, Knox,
and others have acquired that name by their preachings,
their writings, their struggles, and their actions. It is
not so with the principal reformer of England: all his
activity was concentred in the Holy Scriptures. Tyndale
was less prominent than the other instruments of
God, who were awakened to upraise the Church. We
might say, that knowing the weakness of man, he had
retired and hidden himself to allow the Word from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
Heaven to act by itself. He had studied it, translated
it, and sent it over the sea: it must now do its own
work. Is it not written: <i>The field is the world, and the
seed is the Word</i>? But there is another characteristic,
or rather another fact, which distinguishes him from
them, and this we have to describe.</p>

<p class="side">=TYNDALE'S CHARACTERISTIC.=</p>

<p>While the new adversaries of Henry VIII., Pole and
the papistical party, were agitating on the continent,
Tyndale, the man whom the king had pursued so long
without being able to catch, was in prison at Vilvorde,
near Brussels. In vain was he girt around with the
thick walls of that huge fortress. Tyndale was free.
'There is the captivity and bondage,' he could say,
'whence Christ delivered us, redeemed and loosed us.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_441" id="Ref_441" href="#Foot_441">[441]</a></span>
His blood, his death, his patience in suffering rebukes
and wrongs, his prayers and fastings, his meekness and
fulfilling of the uttermost point of the law broke the
bonds of Satan, wherein we were so strait bound.' Thus
Tyndale was as truly free at Vilvorde, as Paul had been
at Rome. He felt pressed to accomplish a vow made
many years before. 'If God preserves my life,' he had
said, 'I will cause a boy that driveth a plow to know
more of the Scriptures than the pope.' True Christianity
shows itself by the attention it gives to Christ's little
ones. It was time for Tyndale to keep his promise.
He occupied his prison hours in preparing for the
humble dwellers in the Gloucestershire villages and the
surrounding counties, an edition of the Bible in which
he employed the language and orthography used in that
part of England.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_442" id="Ref_442" href="#Foot_442">[442]</a></span>
When near his end, he returned
lovingly to the familiar speech of his childhood; he
wrote in the dialect of the peasantry to save the souls of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
the peasants, and for the first time put titles to the
chapters of the Scripture, in order to make the understanding
of it easier to his humbler fellow-countrymen.
Two other editions of the New Testament appeared during
the first year of his captivity. He did more: he
had translated the Old Testament according to the
Hebrew text, and was going to see to the printing of it
just when Philips betrayed him. The fear that this
labor would be lost grieved him even more than his imprisonment:
a friend undertook the work he could no
longer do himself.</p>

<p class="side">=ROGERS AND TYNDALE.=</p>

<p>At that time there lived at Antwerp, as chaplain to
the English merchants in that city, a young man from
the county of Warwick, named Rogers, who had been
educated at Cambridge, and was a little more than
thirty years old. Rogers was learned, but submissive
to the Romish traditions. Tyndale having made his
acquaintance, asked him to help in translating the Holy
Scriptures, and Rogers caught joyfully at the opportunity
of employing his Greek and Hebrew. Close and
constant contact with the Word of God gradually
effected in him that great transformation, that total
renewal of the man which is the object of redemption.
'I have found the true light in the Gospel,' he said one
day to Tyndale; 'I now see the filthiness of Rome, and
I cast from my shoulders the heavy yoke it had imposed
upon me.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_443" id="Ref_443" href="#Foot_443">[443]</a></span>
From that hour Tyndale received from
Rogers the help which he had formerly received from
John Fryth, that pious martyr, whose example Rogers
was to follow by enduring, the first under Mary, the
punishment of fire. The Holy Scriptures have been
written in English with the blood of martyrs—if we
may so speak—the blood of Fryth, Tyndale, and
Rogers: it is a crown of glory for that translation. At
the moment of Tyndale's perfidious arrest, Rogers had
fortunately saved the manuscript of the Old Testament,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
and now resolved to delay the printing no longer.
When the news of this reached the Reformer in his cell
at Vilvorde, it cast a gleam of light upon his latter days
and filled his heart with joy. The <i>whole Bible</i>,—that
was the legacy which the dying Tyndale desired to
leave to his fellow-countrymen. He took pleasure in
his gloomy dungeon in following with his mind's eye
that divine Scripture from city to city and from cottage
to cottage; his imagination pictured to him the struggles
it would have to go through, and also its victories.
'The Word of God,' he said, 'never was without persecution—no
more than the sun can be without his light.
By what right doth the pope forbid God to speak in
the English tongue? Why should not the sermons of
the Apostles, preached no doubt in the mother-tongue
of those who heard them, be now written in the mother-tongue
of those who read them?' Tyndale did not
think of proving the divinity of the Bible by learned
dissertations. 'Scripture derives its authority from
Him who sent it,' he said. 'Would you know the reason
why men believe in Scripture?—It is <i>Scripture</i>.—It
is itself the instrument which outwardly leads men to
believe, whilst inwardly, the spirit of God Himself,
speaking through Scripture, gives faith to His children.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_444" id="Ref_444" href="#Foot_444">[444]</a></span>
We do not know for certain in what city
Rogers printed the great English folio Bible. Hamburg,
Antwerp, Marburg, Lubeck, and even Paris have
been named. Extraordinary precautions were required
to prevent the persecutors from entering the house
where men had the boldness to print the Word of God,
and from breaking the printing-presses. Tyndale had
the great comfort of knowing that the whole Bible was
going to be published, and that prophets, apostles, and
Christ himself would speak by it after his death.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_445" id="Ref_445" href="#Foot_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></div>

<p class="side">=TYNDALE IN PRISON.=</p>

<p>This man, so active, so learned, and so truly great,
whose works circulated far and wide with so much
power, had at the same time within him a pure and
beneficent light—the love of God and of man—which
shed its mild rays on all around him. The depth of his
faith, the charm of his conversation, the uprightness of
his conduct, touched those who came near him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_446" id="Ref_446" href="#Foot_446">[446]</a></span>
The
jailer liked to bring him his food, in order to talk with
him, and his young daughter often accompanied him
and listened eagerly to the words of the pious Englishman.
Tyndale spoke of Jesus Christ; it seemed to
him that the riches of the divine Spirit were about to
transform Christendom; that the children of God were
about to be manifested, and that the Lord was about
<i>to gather together his elect</i>. 'Grace is there, summer is
nigh,' he was wont to say, 'for the trees blossom.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_447" id="Ref_447" href="#Foot_447">[447]</a></span>
In
truth, young shoots and even old trees, long barren,
flourished within the very walls of the castle. The
jailer, his daughter, and other members of their house
were converted to the Gospel by Tyndale's life and doctrine.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_448" id="Ref_448" href="#Foot_448">[448]</a></span>
However dark the machinations of his enemies,
they could not obscure the divine light kindled in his
heart, and which <i>shone before men</i>. There was an
invincible power in this Christian man. Full of hope
in the final victory of Jesus Christ, he courageously
trampled under foot tribulations, trials, and death itself.
He believed in the victory of the Word. 'I am bound
like a malefactor,' he said, 'but the Word of God is not
bound.' The bitterness of his last days was changed
into great peace and divine sweetness.</p>

<p class="side">=EFFORTS TO SAVE TYNDALE.=</p>

<p>His friends did not forget him. Among the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
merchants at Antwerp was one whose affection had
often reminded him that 'friendship is the assemblage
of every virtue,' as a wise man of antiquity styles it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_449" id="Ref_449" href="#Foot_449">[449]</a></span>
Thomas Poyntz, one of whose ancestors had come over
from Normandy with William the Conqueror, had perhaps
known the reformer in the house of Lady Walsh,
who also belonged to this ancient family. For nearly a
year the merchant had entertained the translator of the
Scriptures beneath his roof, and a mutual and unlimited
confidence was established between them. When
Poyntz saw his friend in prison, he resolved to do everything
to save him. Poyntz's elder brother John, who
had retired to his estate at North Okendon, in Essex,
had accompanied the king in 1520 to the Field of the
Cloth of Gold, and although no longer at court, he still
enjoyed the favor of Henry VIII. Thomas determined
to write to John. 'Right well-beloved brother,' he
said, 'William Tyndale is in prison, and like to suffer
death, unless the king should extend his gracious help
to him. He has lain in my house three quarters of a
year, and I know that the king has never a truer-hearted
subject.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_450" id="Ref_450" href="#Foot_450">[450]</a></span>
When the pope gave his Majesty the
title of Defender of the Faith, he prophesied like
Caiaphas. The papists thought our prince should be a
great maintainer of their abominations; but God has
entered his grace into the right battle. The king should
know that the death of this man will be one of the
highest pleasures to the enemies of the Gospel. If it
might please his Majesty to send for this man, it might,
by the means thereof, be opened to the court and council
of this country (Brabant) that they would be at
another point with the bishop of Rome within a short
space.'</p>

<p>John lost no time: he succeeded in interesting Cromwell
in the reformer's cause, and on the 10th of September
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
1535, a messenger arrived in Antwerp with two
letters from the vicar-general—one for the marquis of
Bergen-op-zoom, and the other for Carondelet, archbishop
of Palermo and president of the council of
Brabant. Alas! the marquis had started two days
before for Germany, whither he was conducting the
princess of Denmark. Thomas Poyntz mounted his
horse, and caught up the escort about fifteen miles
from Maestricht. The marquis hurriedly glanced over
Cromwell's dispatch. 'I have no leisure to write,' he
said; 'the princess is making ready to depart.' 'I will
follow you to the next baiting place,' answered Tyndale's
indefatigable friend. 'Be it so,' replied Bergen-op-zoom.</p>

<p>On arriving at Maestricht, the marquis wrote to
Flegge, to Cromwell, and to his friend the archbishop,
president of the council of Brabant, and gave the three
letters to Poyntz. The latter presented the letters of
Cromwell and of the marquis to the president, but the
archbishop and the council of Brabant were opposed to
Tyndale. Poyntz immediately started for London, and
laid the answer of the council before Cromwell, entreating
him to insist that Tyndale should be immediately
set at liberty, for the danger was great. The answer
was delayed a month.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_451" id="Ref_451" href="#Foot_451">[451]</a></span>
Poyntz handed it to the chancery
of Brabant, and every day this true and generous
friend went to the office to learn the result. 'Your
request will be granted,' said one of the clerks on the
fourth day. Poyntz was transported with joy. Tyndale
was saved.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_452" id="Ref_452" href="#Foot_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>The traitor Philips, however, who had delivered him
to his enemies, was then at Louvain. He had run
away from Antwerp, knowing that the English merchants
were angry with him, and had sold his books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
with the intent of escaping to Paris. But the Louvain
priests, who still needed him, reassured him, and remaining
in that stronghold of Romanism, he began to
translate into Latin such passages in Tyndale's writings
as he thought best calculated to offend the catholics.
He was thus occupied when the news of Tyndale's
approaching deliverance filled him and his friends with
alarm. What was to be done? He thought the only
means of preventing the liberation of the prisoner was
to shut up the liberator himself.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_453" id="Ref_453" href="#Foot_453">[453]</a></span>
Philips went straight
to the procurator-general. 'That man, Poyntz,' he
said, 'is as much a heretic as Tyndale.' Two sergeants-at-arms
were sent to keep watch over Poyntz at his
house, and for six days in succession he was examined
upon a hundred different articles. At the beginning of
February 1536, he learnt that he was about to be sent
to prison, and knowing what would follow, he formed a
prompt resolution. One night, when the sergeants-at-arms
were asleep, he escaped and left the city early,
just as the gates were opened. Horsemen were sent in
search of him; but as Poyntz knew the country well,
he escaped them, got on board a ship, and arrived safe
and sound at his brother's house at North Okendon.</p>

<p class="side">=TYNDALE'S FIRMNESS.=</p>

<p>When Tyndale heard of this escape, he knew what
it indicated; but he was not overwhelmed, and almost
at the foot of the scaffold, he bravely fought many
a tough battle. The Louvain doctors undertook to
make him abjure his faith, and represented to him
that he was condemned by the Church. 'The authority
of Jesus Christ,' answered Tyndale, 'is independent
of the authority of the Church.' They called upon him
to make submission to the successor of the Apostle
Peter. 'Holy Scripture,' he said, 'is the first of the
Apostles, and the <i>ruler</i> in the kingdom of Christ.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_454" id="Ref_454" href="#Foot_454">[454]</a></span>
The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
Romish doctors ineffectually attacked him in his prison:
he showed them that they were entangled in vain traditions
and miserable superstitions, and overthrew all
their pretences.</p>

<p>During this time Poyntz was working with all his
might in England to ward off the blow by which his
friend was about to be struck. John assisted Thomas,
but all was useless. Henry just at that time was
making great efforts to arrest some of his subjects,
whom their devotion to the pope had driven out of
England. 'Cover all the roads with spies, in order to
catch them,' he wrote to the German magistrates;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_455" id="Ref_455" href="#Foot_455">[455]</a></span>
but there was not a word about Tyndale. The king
cared very little for these evangelicals. His religion
consisted in rejecting the Roman pontiff and making
himself pope; as for those reformers, let them be burnt
in Brabant, it will save him the trouble.</p>

<p>All hope was not, however, lost. They had confidence
in the vicegerent, the <i>hammer</i> of the monks. On
the 13th of April Vaughan wrote to Cromwell from
Antwerp: 'If you will send me a letter for the privy-council,
I can still save Tyndale from the stake; only
make haste, for if you are slack about it, it will be too
late.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_456" id="Ref_456" href="#Foot_456">[456]</a></span>
But there were cases in which Cromwell could
do nothing without the king, and Henry was deaf. He
had special motives at that time for sacrificing Tyndale:
the discontent which broke out in the North of England
made him desirous of conciliating the Low Countries.
Charles V. also, who was vigorously attacked by Francis
I., prayed <i>his very good brother</i> (Henry VIII.) to unite
with him <i>for the public good of Christendom</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_457" id="Ref_457" href="#Foot_457">[457]</a></span>
Queen
Mary, regent of the Netherlands, wrote from Brussels
to her uncle, entreating him to yield to this prayer, and
the king was quite ready to abandon Tyndale to such
powerful allies. Mary, a woman of upright heart but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
feeble character, easily yielded to outward impressions,
and had at that time bad counsellors about her. 'Those
animals (the monks) are all powerful at the Court of
Brussels,' said Erasmus. 'Mary is only a puppet
placed there by our nation; Montigny is the plaything
of the Franciscans; the cardinal-archbishop of Liège is
a domineering person, and full of violence; and as for
the archbishop of Palermo, he is a mere giver of words
and nothing else.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_458" id="Ref_458" href="#Foot_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>Among such personages, and under their influence,
the court was formed, and the trial of the reformer of
England began. Tyndale refused to be represented by
counsel. 'I will answer my accusers myself,' he said.
The doctrine for which he was tried was this: 'The man
who throws off the worldly existence which he has lived
far from God, and receives by a living faith the complete
remission of his sins, which the death of Christ has
purchased for him, is introduced by a glorious adoption
into the very family of God.' This was certainly a crime
for which a reformer could joyfully suffer. In August
1536, Tyndale appeared before the ecclesiastical court.
'You are charged,' said his judges, 'with having
infringed the imperial decree which forbids any one to
teach that faith alone justifies.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_459" id="Ref_459" href="#Foot_459">[459]</a></span>
The accusation was
not without truth. Tyndale's <i>Unjust Mammon</i> had just
appeared in London under the title: <i>Treatise of Justification
by Faith only</i>. Every man could read in it the
crime with which he was charged.</p>

<p>Tyndale had his reasons when he declared he would
defend himself. It was not his own cause that he
undertook to defend, but the cause of the Bible; a Brabant
lawyer would have supported it very poorly. It
was in his heart to proclaim solemnly, before he died,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
that while all human religions make salvation proceed
from the works of man, the divine religion makes it
proceed from a work of God. 'A man, whom the sense
of his sins has confounded,' said Tyndale, 'loses all
confidence and joy. The first thing to be done to save
him is, therefore, to lighten him of the heavy burden
under which his conscience is bowed down. He must
believe in the perfect work of Christ which reconciles
him completely with God; then he has peace, and
Christ imparts to him, by his Spirit, a holy regeneration.—Yes,'
he exclaimed, 'we believe and are at peace
in our consciences, because that God who cannot lie,
hath promised to forgive us for Christ's sake. As a
child, when his father threateneth him for his fault, hath
never rest till he hear the word of mercy and forgiveness
of his father's mouth again; but as soon as he heareth
his father say, "Go thy way, do me no more so; I forgive
thee this fault!" then is his heart at rest; then
runneth he to no man to make intercession for him;
neither, though there come any false merchant, saying:
"What wilt thou give me and I will obtain pardon of
thy father for thee," will he suffer himself to be beguiled.
No, he will not buy of a <i>wily fox</i> what his father hath
given him freely.'<span

<p class="side">=TYNDALE DEGRADED.=</p>

<p>Tyndale had spoken to the consciences of his hearers,
and some of them were beginning to believe that his
cause was the cause of the Gospel. 'Truly,' exclaimed
the procurator-general, as did formerly the centurion
near the cross; 'truly this was a good, learned, and
pious man.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_461" id="Ref_461" href="#Foot_461">[461]</a></span>
But the priests would not allow so costly
a prey to be snatched from them. Tyndale was declared
guilty of erroneous, captious, rash, ill-sounding, dangerous,
scandalous, and heretical propositions, and was
condemned to be solemnly degraded and then handed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
over to the secular power.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_462" id="Ref_462" href="#Foot_462">[462]</a></span>
They were eager to make
him go through the ceremonial, even all the mummeries,
used on such occasions: it was too good a case to allow
of any curtailment. The reformer was dressed in his
sacerdotal robes, the sacred vessels and the Bible were
placed in his hands, and he was taken before the bishop.
The latter, having been informed of the <i>crime</i> of the accused
man, stripped him of the ornaments of his order,
took away the Bible from the translator of the Bible; and
after a barber had shaved the whole of his head, the
bishop declared him deprived of the crown of the priesthood,
and expelled, like an undutiful child, from the
inheritance of the Lord.</p>

<p>One day would have been sufficient to cut off from
this world the man who was its ornament, and those who
walked in the darkness of fanaticism waited impatiently
for the fatal hour; but the secular power hesitated for
awhile, and the reformer stayed nearly two months
longer in prison, always full of faith, peace, and joy.
'Well,' said those who came near him in the castle of
Vilvorde, 'if that man is not a good Christian, we do
not know of one upon earth.' Religious courage was
personified in Tyndale. He had never suffered himself
to be stopped by any difficulty, privation, or suffering;
he had resolutely followed the call he had received,
which was to give England the Word of God. Nothing
had terrified him, nothing had dispirited him; with admirable
perseverance he had continued his work, and
now he was going to give his life for it. Firm in his
convictions, he had never sacrificed the least truth to
prudence or to fear; firm in his hope, he had never
doubted that the labor of his life would bear fruit, for
that labor had the promises of God. That pious and
intrepid man is one of the noblest examples of Christian
heroism.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></div>

<p class="side">=TYNDALE'S DYING PRAYER.=</p>

<p>The faint hope which some of Tyndale's friends had
entertained, on seeing the delay of justice, was soon destroyed.
The imperial government prepared at last to
complete the wishes of the priests. Friday, the 6th of
October, 1536, was the day that terminated the miserable
but glorious life of the reformer. The gates of the
prison rolled back, a procession crossed the foss and the
bridge, under which slept the waters of the Senne,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_463" id="Ref_463" href="#Foot_463">[463]</a></span>
passed the outward walls, and halted without the fortifications.
Before leaving the castle, Tyndale, a grateful
friend, had intrusted the jailer with a letter intended
for Poyntz; the jailer took it himself to Antwerp not
long after, but it has not come down to us. On arriving
at the scene of punishment, the reformer found a numerous
crowd assembled. The government had wished
to show the people the punishment of a heretic, but
they only witnessed the triumph of a martyr. Tyndale
was calm. 'I call God to record,' he could say, 'that
I have never altered, against the voice of my conscience,
one syllable of his Word. Nor would do this day, if all
the pleasures, honors, and riches of the earth might be
given me.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_464" id="Ref_464" href="#Foot_464">[464]</a></span>
The joy of hope filled his heart: yet one
painful idea took possession of him. Dying far from
his country, abandoned by his king, he felt saddened at
the thought of that prince, who had already persecuted
so many of God's servants, and who remained obstinately
rebellious against that divine light which everywhere
shone around him. Tyndale would not have that soul
perish through carelessness. His charity buried all the
faults of the monarch: he prayed that those sins might
be blotted out from before the face of God; he would
have saved Henry VIII. at any cost. While the executioner
was fastening him to the post, the reformer
exclaimed in a loud and suppliant voice: 'Lord, open
the king of England's eyes!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_465" id="Ref_465" href="#Foot_465">[465]</a></span>
They were his last words.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
Instantly afterwards he was strangled, and flames consumed
the martyr's body. His last cry was wafted to
the British isles, and repeated in every assembly of
Christians. A great death had crowned a great life.
'Such,' says the old chronicler, John Foxe, 'such is the
story of that true servant and martyr of God, William
Tyndale, who, for his notable pains and travail, may
well be called <i>the Apostle of England in this our later age</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_466" id="Ref_466" href="#Foot_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>His fellow-countrymen profited by the work of his
life. As early as 1526 more than twenty editions of
Tyndale's New Testament had been circulated over the
kingdom, and others had followed them. It was like a
mighty river continually bearing new waters to the sea.
Did the reformer's death dry them up suddenly? No.
A greater work still was to be accomplished: the entire
Bible was ready. But could it be circulated? The king
had refused his consent to the circulation of Coverdale's
Bible; would he not do the same with this, and with
greater reason? A powerful protector alone could
secure the free circulation of Scripture. Richard Grafton,
the printer, went to London to ask permission to
sell the precious volume, and with the intention of applying
to Cranmer.</p>

<p>Would Cranmer protect it? The king and Cromwell
had declared against Tyndale, and the primate had
looked on: that was too much his custom. His essentially
prudent mind, the conviction he felt that he
could do no good to the Church unless he kept the
place he occupied, and perhaps his love of life, inclined
him to yield to his master's despotic will. So long as
Henry VIII. was on the throne of England, Cranmer
was (humanly speaking) the only possible reformer. A
John the Baptist, a Knox, would have been dashed to
pieces at the first shock. The sceptre was then an axe;
to save the head, it was necessary to bend it. The
primate, therefore, bent his head frequently. He hid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
himself during the royal anger, but when the storm had
passed he appeared again. The primate was the victim
of an error. He had said that the king ought to command
the Church, and every time the tyrant's order was
heard, he appeared to believe that God himself enjoined
him to obey. Cranmer was the image of his Church
which, under the weight of its greatness and with many
weaknesses hidden beneath its robes, has notwithstanding
always had within it a mighty principle of truth and
life.</p>

<p>Grafton, the printer, had an audience of the archbishop
at Forde, in Kent: he presented the martyr's
Bible, and asked him to procure its free circulation.
The archbishop took the book, examined it, and was
delighted with it. Fidelity, clearness, strength, simplicity,
unction—all were combined in this admirable
translation. Cranmer had much eagerness in proposing
what he thought useful. He sent the volume to Cromwell,
begging him to present it to his Majesty and
obtain permission for it to be sold, 'until such time that
we (the bishops),' he added, 'shall put forth a better
translation—which, I think, will not be till a day after
doomsday.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_467" id="Ref_467" href="#Foot_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=SALE OF THE BIBLE PERMITTED.=</p>

<p>Henry ran over the book: Tyndale's name was not in
it, and the dedication to his Majesty was very well
written. The king regarding (and not without reason)
Holy Scripture as the most powerful engine to destroy
the papal system, and believing that this translation
would help him to emancipate England from the
Romish domination, came to an unexpected resolution:
he authorized the sale and the reading of the Bible
throughout the kingdom. Inconsistent and whimsical
prince! at one and the same time he published and
imposed all over his realm the doctrines of Romanism,
and circulated without obstacle the Divine Word that
overthrew them! We may well say that the blood of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
martyr, precious in the eyes of the Supreme King,
opened the gates of England to the Holy Scriptures.
Cromwell having informed the archbishop of the royal
decision, the latter exclaimed, 'What you have just
done gives me more pleasure than if you had given me
a thousand pounds. I doubt not but that hereby such
fruit of good knowledge shall ensue, that it shall well
appear hereafter, what high and acceptable service you
have done unto God and the king, which shall so much
redound to your honor that (besides God's reward) you
shall obtain perpetual memory for the same.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_468" id="Ref_468" href="#Foot_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=RECEPTION OF THE BIBLE.=</p>

<p>For centuries the English people had been waiting
for such a permission, even from before the time of
Wycliff; and accordingly the Bible circulated rapidly.
The impetuosity with which the living waters rushed
forth, carrying with them everything they met in their
course, was like the sudden opening of a huge floodgate.
This great event, more important than divorces, treaties,
and wars, was the conquest of England by the Reformation.
'It was a wonderful thing to see,' says an old
historian.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_469" id="Ref_469" href="#Foot_469">[469]</a></span>
Whoever possessed the means bought the
book and read it or had it read to him by others. Aged
persons learnt their letters in order to study the Holy
Scriptures of God. In many places there were meetings
for reading; poor people clubbed their savings together
and purchased a Bible, and then in some remote corner
of the church,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_470" id="Ref_470" href="#Foot_470">[470]</a></span>
they modestly formed a circle, and read
the Holy Book between them. A crowd of men, women,
and young folks, disgusted with the barren pomp of the
altars, and with the worship of dumb images, would
gather round them to taste the precious promises of the
Gospel. God himself spoke under the arched roofs of
those old chapels or time-worn cathedrals, where for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
generations nothing had been heard but masses and
litanies. The people wished, instead of the noisy
chants of the priests, to hear the voice of Jesus Christ,
of Paul and of John, of Peter and of James. The
Christianity of the Apostles reappeared in the Church.</p>

<p>But with it came persecution, according to the words
of the Master: <i>The brother shall deliver up the brother to
death, and the father the child</i>. A father exasperated
because his son, a mere boy, had taken part in these
holy readings, caught him by the hair, and put a cord
round his neck to hang him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_471" id="Ref_471" href="#Foot_471">[471]</a></span>
In all the towns and villages
of Tyndale's country the holy pages were opened,
and the delighted readers found therein those treasures
of peace and joy which the martyr had known. Many
cried out with him, 'We know that this Word is from
God, as we know that fire burns; not because any one
has told us, but because a Divine fire consumes our
hearts. O the brightness of the face of Moses! O the
splendor of the glory of Jesus Christ, which no veil conceals!
O the inward power of the Divine word, which
compels us, with so much sweetness, to love and to do!
O the temple of God within us, in which the Son of God
dwells!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_472" id="Ref_472" href="#Foot_472">[472]</a></span>
Tyndale had desired to see the world on fire
by his Master's Word, and that fire was kindled.</p>

<p>The general dissemination of the Holy Scriptures
forms an important epoch in the Reformation of England.
It is like one of those pillars which separate one
territory from another. Here, for the moment, we
suspend our course, and repose for a brief space ere we
turn our steps to other countries.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> Reformation of Geneva, prepared by the restoration
of civil liberty and begun by the reading of the
Word of God and the teaching of various evangelists,
was about to be definitively carried out by the devout
ministry of Froment, Viret, and particularly of Farel.
Afterwards Calvin, in accord with the Councils,
who never renounced their right of intervention, will
strengthen the foundations and organize and crown the
edifice. The civil and ecclesiastical powers had (especially
since the days of Hildebrand) struggled continually
with each other in the different nations of Christendom,
and stirred up hatreds, divisions, and wars. A better
state of things was to take the place of these perpetual
troubles. Church and State were not always to be
united even in Geneva; but they would show more
moderation in their relations, would more frequently
have the same thoughts, and would advance hand in
hand towards a mutual independence, which would not,
however, estrange them from each other.</p>

<p class="side">=IS LIBERTY A BLESSING?.=</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1535 the opposition to Reform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
was still vigorous in that city, whose inhabitants were
discussing the important question whether liberty was a
good or an evil? The partisans of the pope and Savoy
tried to demonstrate to such of the citizens as were
known to be in favor of civil liberty and religious reform,
that their condition would go from bad to worse,
if they did not accept the sovereignty of their bishop,
the protectorate of a neighboring prince, and the supremacy
of the pope—three masters for one. The fruits of
that independence with which they were so captivated,
would be (they said) agitation, disorder, violence, and
misery. The feudal party was sincerely convinced that
the path of liberty is rugged and dangerous; that he
who follows it stumbles, falls, and is ruined; and that
whether a nation be great or small, it needs an absolute
and energetic power to keep it in order. They advised
the Genevese to lay aside their fine theories, their old
parchments, and their ancient franchises, and to take a
master if they desired to see peace, wealth, pleasure,
and prosperity abound within their walls.</p>

<p>The citizens rejected this advice. They believed that
as the liberties they possessed came from their fathers,
they ought not to rob their children of them. They
knew that independence had dangers, privations, and
troubles to which they must submit. But life itself is
not without them, and we should not think that a
reason for making away with it. If God has enriched
man with noble faculties, it is not that he may mutilate
or stifle them, but develop, regulate, and increase them.
No man worthy of the name voluntarily accepts laws in
the making of which he has had no share. Cæsarism,
violence, and secret societies cannot be substituted in a
nation for independence, justice, and publicity. Despotism
dwarfs a man, liberty strengthens him. To take it
away in order to prevent abuses, is to change the work
and plan of the Creator.</p>

<p>And yet everything seemed to indicate that liberty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
and reform were about to be destroyed in Geneva. An
assembly of the Swiss Cantons held, as we have seen, at
Lucerne on the 1st of January, 1535, had been occupied
about Geneva; and Berne, the only canton that wished
well to the Genevese, had consented that the bishop and
the duke should be reinstated in the rights which they
pretended to possess, provided religion remained free;
for, the Bernese had added, 'faith is the gift of God.'
But the envoys of Savoy had demanded the complete
and unconditional recognition of the absolute authority
of the duke and the bishop, which alone (they affirmed)
could put an end to all hatred and effusion of blood.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_473" id="Ref_473" href="#Foot_473">[473]</a></span>
The diet had decided on this, so that the reformation
and independence of Geneva were about to be annihilated
by the Swiss themselves.</p>

<p class="side">=HUGUENOT MAGISTRATES ELECTED.=</p>

<p>But it is when men draw back that help is nearest.
If all were resolved, outside of Geneva, to destroy its
Reformation, the small phalanx of citizens within its
walls was not less resolved to uphold it. Three parties
called for it alike. The old huguenots wanted it to be
immediate, violent even if necessary; the magistrates
wished it to be legal, slow, and diplomatic; and the
evangelicals desired it to be spiritual and peaceably accomplished
by the Word of God. There were many
pious souls in the houses of people of mark, as well as in
obscure dwellings, who cried to God day and night for
the triumph of the good cause. That little city of 12,000
souls had determined to resist the powers who wanted
to crush it. Without hesitation, without fear, Geneva
trusted in God and marched onwards. The period (7th
of February) having arrived at which the magistrates
were elected every year, the Genevese resolutely voted
to the first offices of the state the friends of independence
and reform.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_474" id="Ref_474" href="#Foot_474">[474]</a></span>
Among the councillors there were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
also some of the most decided huguenots.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_475" id="Ref_475" href="#Foot_475">[475]</a></span>
With such
men—with Farel, Viret, and Froment within its walls,
and with the Divine protection, the transformation of
Geneva seemed imminent, notwithstanding the efforts
of Switzerland, Piedmont, the emperor, and the pope.</p>

<p>The government party desired to precipitate nothing;
they intended to conciliate opposite opinions, and to
seek a certain middle course which would satisfy everybody;
but the cause of the Reformation and of liberty
fermented in many hearts. Those waters, which the
magistrates would have desired to see motionless, were
strongly agitated, and the Roman ship, already dismasted,
might be suddenly engulfed. Almost every day
some citizen, some woman, or even some monk, left the
Church of the pope and entered the Church of the
Gospel; or else some foreign Christian, who had
forsaken everything to obey his conscience, entered the
free city, principally by the gate of France. Those
pious refugees were received like brothers. People
gathered round them, looked at them, and questioned
them. The strangers told how they had waged a
bitter war, endured vile reproaches, wept much and
groaned much; but the annoyances they had suffered
(they added) appeared light, now that they had found
deliverance and liberty. The Christians of Geneva were
strengthened by the faith of these noble confessors of
Jesus Christ. The reforming torrent increased, it was
seen rushing against the weakened barriers. The
Roman-catholics both from without and within vainly
endeavored to check it; it was about to sweep away the
worm-eaten timbers of popery.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_476" id="Ref_476" href="#Foot_476">[476]</a></span>
The council, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
seemed motionless. The ardent Bandière was pushing
forward, the catholic Philippin was holding back; but
the halfway opinions of the chief syndic and of Du
Molard finally prevailed.</p>

<p>The moderate party agreed that some concession
ought to be made to the evangelical party, if they wished
to remain in office. A good opportunity occurred of
realizing this plan. They discovered a gray friar who
offered to preach the Word of God, while wearing the
hood of St. Francis. To give a mitigated Gospel, under
a Roman form, is the plan ordinarily chosen by those
who have set peace before truth. One or two days after
the election of syndics, the cordelier, supported by the
council, asked the Chapter for a place to preach in.
The canons, who were a little mistrustful, examined
him: he wore the brown frock of St. Francis, and a
cord served him for a girdle. Still they feared there
was something underneath. 'Go to the vicar-episcopal,
who lives at Gex,' they said. The 'evangelical monk'
did so; but the vicar also regarded him with an uneasy
look. 'My lord bishop,' he answered, 'will soon come
to Geneva; he will bring with him whatever preacher
he likes.' The poor Franciscan came back and told the
council that they had bowed him out everywhere. Two
councillors now waited upon the Chapter to support the
monk's petition; when some of them, who lived as
canons do, as idly as can be imagined, suddenly found
that they had their hands full. 'We have to read the
service,' they answered, 'and it is so long! and then
there is other work to do; there is the procession, in
which we must walk in order. We have not the time
to think about preaching! Make the best arrangement
you can.' The council was disgusted. To bawl out
litanies, that was a pressing matter; but to have the
Word of God preached was a supererogatory work.
'Well then,' said the offended syndics to the monk, 'we
will give you a place ourselves,' and they assigned him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
the church of St. Germain, situated in a district devoted
to catholicism. This was Saturday, 12th of February,
the eve of the first Sunday in Lent.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_477" id="Ref_477" href="#Foot_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>The report of this decision threw the catholics of the
parish into confusion, and there were violent scenes in
many a household. The women were beside themselves;
they abused their husbands, called them cowards, and
enjoined them to oppose the monk's sermon. One of
them, by name Pernette, was distinguished in this opposition.
Small, fat, short-legged, and with her head
between the shoulders, she was so like a ball that they
called her in the city <i>Touteronde</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_478" id="Ref_478" href="#Foot_478">[478]</a></span>
But a restless spirit
agitated her little body, and a big voice came out of it.
Pernette bestirred herself, plotted in-doors, shouted in
the streets, and at last went to see the parish-priest.</p>

<p>The priest of St. Germain and bishop's procurator-fiscal
was Thomas Vandel, brother of Robert, Pierre, and
Hugues. He was an undecided character, disposed to
walk like his brothers in the way of independence, but
close ties attached him to the bishop, and he hesitated.
Divided in heart, he was continually driven backwards
and forwards by opposing sentiments.</p>

<p>For the moment, thanks to the efforts of certain
canons and noble ladies, the wind at the parsonage was
favorable for the papacy. Certain huguenots, however,
were just then speaking in a loud voice; and Vandel,
unwilling to pronounce for either side, threw the burden
on the principal members of his parish, by requesting
them to present a petition to the council.</p>

<p class="side">=A RIOT IN CHURCH.=</p>

<p>On Sunday morning a little before the hour at which
the monk was to preach, the deputation proceeded to
the hôtel-de-ville. The members were really speaking
for their wives. There was no question of heresy. 'We
fear that there may be a disturbance,' they said, 'and
therefore beg to have our usual service.' The syndics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
answered, 'You will hear the preacher. If he preaches
well, he shall stay; but if he preaches any novelty, anything
contrary to Holy Scripture, he will be expelled.'
Accordingly the priest had it announced in the church
that the monk would preach <i>by order of the council</i>.
The women and a few men returned to their homes
much irritated. An insurrection was at once organized;
a clerical partisan collected a number of the parishioners
about him in the street and shouted out, 'Shut the
church doors against the gray friar.' Pernette, who
was there, went home, caught up a great wooden pestle
with which she used to pound salt,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_479" id="Ref_479" href="#Foot_479">[479]</a></span>
and brandishing it
like a club, marched fiercely to the combat. A great
number of women, among whom were some of rather
questionable morality, surrounded her, crying, 'The
Lutherans want to give us a preacher. Oh, the dogs,
the dogs!' Pernette raised her pestle and declared
she would brain the first heretic who dared approach
the pulpit. Her bellicose companions followed her, entered
the church, drew up in battle-array, and waited
for the enemy. Directly the cordelier appeared, they
began to make a great uproar,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_480" id="Ref_480" href="#Foot_480">[480]</a></span>
and rushed in front of
him, shouting and tossing their arms and their weapons.
Pernette got on a chair, and brandished the pestle over
their heads. The Reformed who had entered the doors
gathered round the preacher, crying, 'Forward, courage!'
and made a way for the monk, who, little by little,
reached the foot of the pulpit. 'Then,' says sister
Jeanne de Jussie, 'that apostate from St. Francis, who
still wore the robe of the holy order, began to preach
in the heretical fashion.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_481" id="Ref_481" href="#Foot_481">[481]</a></span>
But as soon as the Franciscan
opened his mouth, Pernette gave the signal by
raising her pestle, and immediately the bigots of both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
sexes made such an uproar that the cordelier was compelled
to be silent.</p>

<p>The council, unwilling to see their orders defied, took
proceedings against the rioters. The friend of the
priests who had prompted the insurrection lost his
citizenship; Pernette was condemned to a few days'
imprisonment on bread and water; and two other
women of loose conduct were banished from the city.
From that time the cordelier preached in peace; and
the <i>curé</i> seeing which way the wind was blowing, graciously
received him into his own house. Before long
he began to have a liking for the monk's opinions, and
appeared to range himself on the side of the Gospel.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_482" id="Ref_482" href="#Foot_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>This victory—as was natural—precipitated the movement
of the Reformation in Geneva. Easter day was
kept with much fervor by the friends of the Gospel.
They went in considerable numbers to the Lord's table,
which was spread at the Rive convent. Husbands accompanied
their wives; the young guided the old.
Some huguenots, who probably were not among the
communicants, wishing to prove to the catholics, that
although they were in the last days of Holy Week, the
bells had not made a journey to Rome, as the priests
led the superstitious people to believe, rang them in
loud peals on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, says
sister Jeanne.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_483" id="Ref_483" href="#Foot_483">[483]</a></span>
The fanatical adversaries of the Reformation,
exasperated by this progress, were about to
take a cruel revenge.</p>

<p class="side">=THE PIOUS KNIGHT OF RHODES.=</p>

<p>Gaudet of St. Cloud, near Paris, a pious man and
formerly knight of Rhodes,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_484" id="Ref_484" href="#Foot_484">[484]</a></span>
saw with joy this active
movement of Reform. Accordingly, he had left his
uncle, the Commander of Rhodes, Sire Loys Brunis de
Compésières, a man heartily devoted to the pope, and
had gone and settled in Geneva with his wife and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
household. The city of the huguenots was specially
adapted to offer a refuge to the exiles. Then, at least,
there was no exclusive aristocracy; every individuality
had its place. Any one might by his intelligence and
energy take his seat among the notables. Gaudet,
touched by these liberal manners, and edified by the
zeal with which Farel and the other ministers scattered
the true doctrine of the Son of God amidst great difficulties,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_485" id="Ref_485" href="#Foot_485">[485]</a></span>
lived happily in Geneva, heard the preaching
and even preached himself, which seemed extraordinary
in a knight of Rhodes. One day a Genevese Roman-catholic,
visiting the Commander of Compésières, told
him what his nephew was doing. When Sire Loys heard
that the knight of Rhodes was turning heretic and
preacher, he resolved to get him out of so dangerous a
city, and to that end gave his visitor a letter in which
Gaudet was invited to go to Gex, where he would find
important news from Paris. Gaudet set off. It was
not an easy thing at that time to make this journey.
Genevese mamelukes, Savoyard knights, and other brigands
filled the castle of Peney. Perched on the walls,
they kept watch on all the surrounding country, and as
soon as they perceived a traveller, they swooped down
upon their prey, and carried him off to their eyrie.
Their brigandage was the chief topic of conversation in
all the country round. 'On the 9th of February of
this year,' people said at Geneva, 'three cordeliers and
two printers, all disciples of the Gospel, who had come
from France and were journeying hither, were carried
away from the inn at which they had halted by twelve
arquebusiers from Peney. A little later another Frenchman
was taken, tortured, and hanged. Between the
1st and 5th of April several Genevans were taken to
the castle with their hands tied behind them like criminals.
A huguenot, condemned, without proof, of having
helped to drive the bishop out of Geneva, was torn limb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
from limb by horses in the courtyard at Peney. The
garrison of that castle creates continual alarm night
and day; and carries off cattle, goods, and even men,
women and children.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_486" id="Ref_486" href="#Foot_486">[486]</a></span>
Such savage acts were of a
nature to prevent Gaudet from acting upon his uncle's
invitation; but a knight of Rhodes knows no fear. He
reached Gex on the 22d of June without hindrance,
and departed the next morning. He was travelling
without suspicion when some armed men pounced upon
him and carried him off to the castle of Peney.</p>

<p class="side">=THE KNIGHT CRUELLY TORTURED.=</p>

<p>The fanatics who had taken up their abode there,
tried to bring Gaudet back to the teaching of Rome;
but as their efforts were useless, they took other means
which doubtless were not to be found in his uncle's
instructions. They kept him for about five days in
great torment.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_487" id="Ref_487" href="#Foot_487">[487]</a></span>
'If you will recant,' they said, 'your
life shall be spared.' But the ex-knight knew that we
have to fight continually, and he had the doctrine of
salvation too deeply engraved in his heart to forget it.
'He remained constant,' say the chroniclers, 'supporting
the cause of the Gospel.' The men of Peney had not
expected this. In their eyes Gaudet's firmness was
criminal obstinacy, and they resolved 'to put him to
the cruellest death ever heard of in this country.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_488" id="Ref_488" href="#Foot_488">[488]</a></span>
They
determined that he should be 'burnt alive over a slow
fire, for having settled at Geneva, for having attended
sermons, and heard and preached the Gospel.' That
was his crime. Wishing to let their neighbors enjoy
a spectacle so worthy of being seen, the gentlemen
invited the peasantry of the neighborhood, men,
women, and children, to be present. Gaudet was
brought from his dungeon, and taken into the castle
yard, which was filled with spectators, and there fastened
to a post. One of the Peneysans brought some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
embers and placed them 'neatly' under his feet; when
the soles of his feet were burnt, the fire was removed
and passed in succession over the different parts of the
body. But the Christian knight remained firm. He
knew that when God puts his Holy Spirit into a man,
he cannot fail, although the heavens should fall. His
cruel torturers showed as much determination as he did.
They said that Gaudet was a member of that famous
order of St. John of Jerusalem founded in the Holy
Land, placed under the protection of the holy see, and
which had defended with so much glory the Cross
against the Crescent. The knowledge that one of its
knights had joined the heretics, that he had even become
a preacher, transported them with fury. Seeing that
their burning coals did nothing, they tied the disciple
of the Gospel to a pillar, stood round him with their
arms, and, more cruel than the Red Indians, began to
prick him all over with their spears and halberds.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_489" id="Ref_489" href="#Foot_489">[489]</a></span>
Gaudet, forgivingly, blessed his enemies. 'You are
putting me to death,' he said, 'because I have preached
the Word of God. I call to the God of mercy, and pray
that He will pardon the sufferings you inflict upon
me.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_490" id="Ref_490" href="#Foot_490">[490]</a></span></p>

<p>The martyr was visibly sinking, but he ceased not to
invoke the name of Christ; and 'that invocation,' says
the chronicler, 'brought him alleviation in his bitter
torments.' He had put his hope in the faithfulness of
the unseen God. The punishment and the joy of the
martyr had a different effect upon the spectators from
what had been expected. They were seized with horror;
they uttered deep sighs, and 'departed weeping and
groaning to their homes, being grieved at such an outrage.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_491" id="Ref_491" href="#Foot_491">[491]</a></span>
At length Gaudet, exhausted, rendered up his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
soul to God, two days after he had been fastened to the
pillar. Geneva, who had had her martyrs of liberty, now
had her martyrs of faith.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_492" id="Ref_492" href="#Foot_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ATTACK ON PENEY.=</p>

<p>So cruel an action revolted every heart. The priests
said: 'It will do us more mischief than twenty of
Farel's sermons.' The huguenots exclaimed that the
brigands' nest must be destroyed. The relatives of the
citizens confined in it feared lest they should meet with
Gaudet's fate, and called for their deliverance. The
council met one night after supper, the gates of the city
being already closed, and the attack of Peney was
proposed. They were reminded, in vain, 'that it contained
old soldiers, men tried in war, and that the castle
was strong and well supplied with artillery.' Gaudet's
cruel punishment carried the day: the proposal for
attacking was voted. The herald passed through the
dark streets, with orders that every man, bearing arms,
should go to his muster-place without delay. A force of
nearly five hundred men and two pieces of artillery left
the city. About an hour after midnight, the little army
was under the walls of the fortress. All was quiet:
everybody was asleep. Unfortunately, the ladders had
not yet arrived, and the Genevese, fearing they would be
observed if the assault was deferred, pointed their cannons
and fired a shot. The men-at-arms in the castle
were aroused: at first they imagined they were taken,
says the chronicler; but recovered themselves before
long. Some rang the alarm-bell to call their friends
from outside, others ran to the ramparts. Renouncing
their idea of scaling the walls, the Genevese aimed their
cannons at the gate and battered it down; the Peneysans
immediately set up another. Bullets and cannonballs
rained on the besiegers, the walls seemed on fire.
Some of the Genevese fell where they stood; others,
who were wounded, retired out of gunshot, and sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
down mournfully by the road-side. At this moment it
was reported that M. de Lugrin, who commanded at
Gex, was approaching with his troops. As the Genevans
were about to be caught between two fires, the
commanders ordered a retreat.</p>

<p>Everybody crowded to the gates to receive the discomfited
force. What a disaster! women looking for
their husbands, mothers for their sons! 'What remedy
can be found for the ills that now oppress us?' was the
cry. The voices of the Reformers revived their drooping
spirits, and said: 'God will do other and greater
things. He will deliver you from your enemies, but by
other means which you do not understand, in order that
the honor may be entirely paid to Him, and not to your
human enterprises and artillery.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_493" id="Ref_493" href="#Foot_493">[493]</a></span>
The Genevans
neglected nothing for their defence. They took the
bells from the convents and cast them into cannon; they
cleared away the walls of the faubourgs which still
existed; they established a permanent force to protect
the open country and seek provisions; and, finally, sent
away the traitors whom they found in the city. They
trusted in God, but they wished to be ready for battle.</p>

Many would only employ lawful arms; but there were
some who were by no means scrupulous as to the means
adopted to vanquish the enemies of Rome. Fanatics
make a false conscience for themselves, and then look
upon culpable actions as good ones. Empire was slipping
from the hands of the Church; it must, at any
cost, be restored to her, thought the extravagant Roman-catholics
of Geneva. Canon Gruet, in particular—his
<i>famulus</i>, Gardet the priest, and Barbier, in the service
of the bishop of Maurienne, thought that, as neither
duke, bishop, nor mameluke could do anything, other
means must be devised to check that furious torrent
which threatened to sweep away papacy, temples, priests,
and images. Fanatics, whom the wise men of catholicism
are unanimous in condemning, were plotting in
the dark and muttering softly that as Farel, Viret, and
Froment were all living in the same house, they could
easily be got rid of at one blow. Some inkling of these
guilty designs got abroad, and the Reformers were
warned to be on their guard; but such plots did not
trouble them. 'If we were all three dead,' said Froment,
'God would soon raise up others. Out of stones
can He not raise up children unto Abraham?' The work
of darkness began.<span

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></div>

<p>There lived in Geneva at that time a married woman
and mother of a family, Antonia Vax by name; she was
of quick perception, melancholy temperament, enthusiastic
imagination, weak rather than depraved. In
those days poison was much used; Bonivard had often
related, 'how pope Alexander VI., wishing to have the
money and benefices of two or three cardinals, had
drunk in mistake from the flagon in which stood the
poisoned wine, and had been caught in his own trap.'
Antonia had seen poison employed. When in service
at Lyons, nine years before, she had remarked that one
of her companions always carried with him a little box
piously covered with an <i>Agnus Dei</i>: 'It contains sublimate,'
he had told her. More than once after this,
when the unfortunate woman, of dark and dreamy
temperament, felt the vapors rise to her brain, she had
cried out: 'How wretched I am! how I should like to
be out of this world! If I only had some sublimate!'
At Bourg she had seen her mistress, in complicity with a
Spanish doctor, give her husband poison; and entering
afterwards the household of an illustrious family, the
Seigneur de Challe, nephew to the bishop of Maurienne,
she had seen her master poison his mother's husband.
After this Antonia came to Geneva with her husband
and children.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_495" id="Ref_495" href="#Foot_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ANTONIA AND THE PRIESTS.=</p>

<p>Barbier, one of the chief instigators of the plot, had
known Antonia when she was in M. de Challe's service.
On his return from a conference held at Thonon, he cast
his eyes upon her to carry out the guilty designs formed
by him and his accomplices. At Geneva, as in England,
it was a woman whom the misguided priests selected to
strike the blow which they hoped would destroy the Reformation.
Neither of those wretched women was
deprived of all moral sentiment; but the heated imaginations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
of the maid of Kent and of Antonia, and
their unhealthy sensibility, made them embrace enthusiastically
the schemes of wicked and crafty men.
Barbier accosted the woman Vax, spoke to her of the
preachers, and of the ills which threatened Holy Church;
and when he thought he had sufficiently prepared the
ground, he represented to her the great service she
would do to religion, if she freed Geneva from the
heretics. 'If any suspicions should be aroused,' he
added, 'you will only have to remove to Canon Gruet's,
secretary to Monseigneur of Maurienne.' Antonia
hesitated. Some monks of the abbey of Ambournay, in
Bresse, whom she had known, and who were then at
Geneva, got round her, and endeavored to persuade her
that such an action would merit the glory of heaven.
She appeared sensible to their persuasions, and yet the
deed was repugnant to her. To decide her, Barbier
took her to D'Orsière, a canon held in great esteem.
'Act, act boldly,' said the canon; 'you need not be
anxious.' The unhappy woman yielded.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_496" id="Ref_496" href="#Foot_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<p>The next step was to prepare the means: by representing
her as a poor woman who fled to Geneva for the
Gospel, they contrived to get her admitted into Claude
Bernard's house, where Farel, Viret, and Froment
lodged. Bernard's heart was touched, and he engaged
Antonia to wait upon his three guests, who took their
meals apart. She knew so well how to play her part,
that she was in fact regarded as one of the more fervent
seekers of the Gospel. To procure poison was not
difficult: she had lived for some time with Michael
Vallot, the apothecary, and continued to go there. One
day she paid him a visit, and, at a propitious moment,
caught up some poison in a box and ran away.</p>

<p>When the poison was in her hands, she had still (as
it would appear) a moment of uneasiness; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
wretches, whose tool she was, pressed her to deliver
Geneva from heresy. Accordingly, on the 8th of March,
Antonia, taking courage, prepared some spinach soup,
which she made very thick, for fear the poison should
be noticed, threw in the sublimate, and, entering the
room where Farel, Viret, and Froment were at table,
put the deadly broth before them. Farel looked at it,
found it too thick for his taste, and, though he had no
suspicion, asked for some household soup. Froment,
less dainty than Farel, had taken the spoon, and was
about to lift it to his mouth, when some one came in
and informed him that his wife and children had just
arrived in Geneva. He rose hastily, 'leaving everything,'
and ran off to meet them. Viret was left, still
pale and suffering from the sword-cut he had received
from a priest near Payerne. The perfidious Antonia
had told him that she would make him some soup 'good
for his stomach,' and he therefore ate tranquilly the food
she had 'dressed to kill him.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_497" id="Ref_497" href="#Foot_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<p>The crime was accomplished. If the good providence
of God had miraculously saved two of the evangelists,
the third was to all appearance lost. At this moment
the wretched woman suddenly became agitated; her
conscience reproached her with her crime; and bursting
into tears, she ran hurriedly to the kitchen, where she
began to moan. 'What is the matter with you?' asked
her companions: but she made no answer. Unable to
resist her remorse, and believing pure water to be a good
antidote to the poison, she formed the resolution of
saving her victim, poured some water into a glass,
hurried up-stairs, and desired Viret to drink it. The
latter was astonished, and wanted at least to know the
reason of such a request. She refused to tell him, but
did not cease begging him until he had drunk. Froment,
much irritated against the woman, regarded her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
emotion as 'mere crocodile's tears;' he says so in his
Chronicle. We are inclined to believe them sincere.</p>

<p class="side">=FLIGHT OF ANTONIA.=</p>

<p>Viret became ill, and his friends were heart-broken.
'Alas!' said Froment, 'we expect death for him, and
not life.' People asked the cause of this sudden illness,
and Antonia, suspected of knowing something about it,
was seized with terror. She felt herself already caught
and sentenced. 'I know very well that it is no <i>sport</i>,'
she exclaimed. Her imagination was heated; she went
to the house where her children lived, and, taking the
youngest in her arms, leading a second by the hand, the
others following her, she ran with alarm to the shore of
the lake, wishing to escape, and her little ones with her.
'Take me away from the city,' she said to the boatmen.
They carried her as far as Coppet, about three
leagues off. Claude Bernard and one or two of his
friends, who had reasons for mistrusting the woman,
jumped into a boat, and, having found her, brought her
back. They did not, however, charge her with anything;
but her conscience accused her: her agitation
kept increasing during the passage; and her haggard
eyes were fixed upon her old master, his friends, and
the boatmen. 'You are betraying me,' she said: 'you
are playing me a trick.' At length they arrived.
Antonia got out of the boat first, and while Bernard and
his friends were occupied in landing the children, she
slipped away lightly, plunged into a dark alley between
the Molard and the Fusterie, hurried through it, climbed
the Rue de la Pélisserie, and reached the house of Canon
D'Orsière, who had said to her: 'Act, act boldly, you
need not be anxious.'—'Save me!' she exclaimed. The
canon hid her in his cellar. But some people had seen
a woman pass hurriedly along: the officers of justice
searched the canon's house, found Antonia crouching in
a dark underground cellar, and took her away to prison,
where she confessed everything.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Viret was in peril of death, and, as there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
was no woman at Bernard's to tend him, Dame Pernette,
a pious Christian, and wife of the councillor Michael
Balthasard, begged that he might be removed to her
house, which was done. Froment, who went to see him
often, said: 'Really, Dame Pernette is doing him a
great service, and showing him great kindness.' One
doctor said he was poisoned, another denied it. The
whole city was filled with the affair: men and women
assembled and expressed their sorrow. 'Must the
Church be robbed of such a pearl,' they said, 'by such a
miserable creature?... Poor Viret! Poor reformers!...
Sword-cuts in the back, poison in
front.... Such are the rewards of those who preach
the Gospel!' Viret was saved, but he felt the effects of
the poison all his life.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_498" id="Ref_498" href="#Foot_498">[498]</a></span></p>

<p>The investigation began on the 13th of April.
Antonia was not of a character to conceal her crime:
the <i>vénéfique</i>, as they called the poisoner, declared openly
she was led into it by the 'round caps (the clergy).'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_499" id="Ref_499" href="#Foot_499">[499]</a></span>
The priests, and even the canon who had ruined her, were
arrested and taken to prison. A canon arrested by laymen!
All the clergy were in commotion: Aimé de
Gingins, the bishop's vicar-general, represented to the
syndics that a canon ought not to be imprisoned by
anybody, not being a subject of the State, but only of
the chapter. The magistrates declared that the investigation
of criminal matters belonged to them, and the
priests were forced to submit to be tried according to
the common law—a great innovation in the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p class="side">=EXECUTION OF ANTONIA.=</p>

<p>Antonia was condemned to have her head cut off, her
body hung on the gibbet of Champel, and her head
fixed on a nail. At first she remained firm. 'Take
care, my lords,' she said, 'that your servants do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
poison you, for there are many who practise it.' But
when she had returned to prison, she became quite
prostrated. Pale and speechless, she rolled her haggard
eyes around her. It was still worse when she was led
to the place of execution. Her mind wandered: she
was like one of those personages spoken of in antiquity,
who were said to be pursued by the Furies. Although
surrounded by an immense crowd, she did not observe
it: her eyes seemed fixed on some mysterious beings.
She fancied she saw the priests of Geneva and the
monks of Ambournay standing round her. 'Take them
away, take them away!' she exclaimed, waving her hand;
and as the guards showed by their looks of astonishment
that they did not know what she meant, 'Take
them away,' she resumed, pointing with her finger at what
she believed she saw; 'in heaven's name take away
those <i>round-caps</i> who are before me; ... it is they
who are the cause of my death!' Having mounted the
scaffold, she cried out again in great anguish: 'Take
them away!' and her head fell.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_500" id="Ref_500" href="#Foot_500">[500]</a></span>
She paid dearly for
her crime—a crime too frequent in those days, when
fanatics thought it their duty to serve by violence the
cause which they said was the cause of God. The
adversaries of the Reformation, in the countries which it
reached, have too frequently employed the arms of
iniquity against it.</p>

<p>The guilty project of getting rid of the three Reformers
at once had the opposite consequences to what its
authors had hoped. The atrocity of the attempt increased
the love of the people for the Reform, and detracted
greatly from the reputation of the priests. The
most sinister reports were circulated about them. It
was said that they had tried to poison the bread and
wine of the Lord's Supper, in order to cut off all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
reformed at a blow. People shrank from them in the
streets as they passed, as if their simple approach could
inflict death.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_501" id="Ref_501" href="#Foot_501">[501]</a></span></p>

<p>All Geneva was in commotion: a transformation of
that little state became imminent. At this time ambitious
popes and despotic princes exercised absolute
power. Two kinds of enfranchisement were necessary
for Christendom: that of the nation and that of the
Church. The Genevese sought after both: some rallied
round the banner of faith, others round that of
liberty; but the more enlightened minds saw that these
two holy causes should never be separated; and that
the political awakening of a nation can only succeed so
far as the awakening of the conscience tends to prevent
disorder.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_502" id="Ref_502" href="#Foot_502">[502]</a></span>
In no country, perhaps, were these two
movements so simultaneous as in Geneva. Certain natural
phenomena are studied in microscopic animalcules:
a moral phenomenon may be illustrated in the history
of this small city which may be enunciated in these
words: 'He who desires to be free must believe.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_503" id="Ref_503" href="#Foot_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<p>The Gospel, however, was not as yet triumphant.
While the Roman-catholics always had their parishes,
their churches, and numerous priests, the reformed had
but one place of worship, and three ministers. Such a
state of things could not last long. An important event
occurred to hasten the victory of the Gospel and of
liberty.</p>

<p class="side">=JACQUES BERNARD CONVERTED.=</p>

<p>At the very moment when a pious reformer was descending
near to the gates of death, the head of the
Franciscans in Geneva was taking the new road 'that
leadeth unto life.' The three brothers Bernard—Claude,
the elder, in whose house the reformers received
a Christian hospitality; Louis, priest of St. Pierre; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
Jacques, guardian or superior of the Franciscan convent—were
among the most notable citizens of Geneva.
The two elder had for some time embraced the Reform;
but the third, a monk, had remained a zealot for popery.
Ere long he himself was shaken. Seeing the three
ministers closely at his brother Claude's, he learnt by
their life to esteem their doctrine, and their virtues
struck him so much the more, as he had lived in popery
a life by no means regular himself. He examined himself
seriously whether he would not do well to renounce
monasticism.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_504" id="Ref_504" href="#Foot_504">[504]</a></span>
The light of the Gospel began to shine
into his heart. Nothing struck him so much as the
thought that Christ, in his great love, had procured for
his followers by his death a <i>perfect</i> reconciliation with
God. The character which popery ascribed to the mass
appeared to him to do injury to the infinite price of the
Saviour's passion. 'I am convinced,' said he to Farel,
at the end of one of their conversations. 'I am one of
you!'—'Good!' answered the reformer, 'but if faith is
kindled in your heart, it is necessary that the light
should be shown abroad. Confess your faith publicly
before men.' Jacques was determined not to spare himself,
and not only to declare for the Gospel, but, further,
to endeavor to make it known to his fellow-citizens.
He posted up bills on February 19th, that during Lent
he would preach every afternoon in the convent church.</p>

<p>This was something new: a numerous crowd filled the
place. 'Men and women, catholics and Lutherans,
crowded in,' says the nun of Ste. Claire, 'and that
during all the first week.' Some fancied that the guardian
was going to thunder against the Reform; but all
doubts were soon dispersed. He spoke, and the astonishment
was universal. The reformed were surprised at
seeing one who formerly had rejected so rudely the
grace of Christ, now rushing like a common soldier into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
the midst of the battle and defending it. The catholics
were still more amazed. 'This scandalized them so
much,' adds the sister, 'that they never went afterwards.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_505" id="Ref_505" href="#Foot_505">[505]</a></span>
It seemed impossible to come to an understanding,
and the confusion continued increasing.</p>

<p>How could they get out of a struggle which looked as
if it would never end? There appeared one very natural
means which does honor to the epoch in which men had
recourse to it. The magistrates of the sixteenth century,
whether in Switzerland or elsewhere, studied their
charters when there was a question of establishing what
was right, and assimilated the principles which had
dictated them. But their love of the right was not a
platonic love, as among enervated jurists. These
notable men wished to realize in the government of the
people what was in its constitution. Now if the book of
the <i>Liberties, Franchises, Immunities, Uses, and Customs</i>
of Geneva was the charter of the state, the <i>Holy Scriptures</i>
were the charter of the Church: the Bible was the
grand muniment of their spiritual franchises. Nothing
must be decided, therefore, except by this sovereign
rule.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_506" id="Ref_506" href="#Foot_506">[506]</a></span>
While such thoughts occupied the syndics, the
same desire animated the Reformers. 'We will forfeit
our lives,' they said, 'if we do not prove by Holy
Scripture that what we preach is true.' A conference,
at which, with the divine charter before them, the faith,
duties, and rights of Christians should be established,
seemed the wisest way of getting out of the difficulty.</p>

<p class="side">=A PUBLIC DISCUSSION DEMANDED.=</p>

<p>One thing stopped the members of the council: they
were reluctant that foreigners—two Frenchmen and a
Vaudois—should be at the head of the disputation.
Farel respected such a feeling, and desired that the
name of an old Genevan should be inscribed first in
Geneva on the list of the Reformation. He went to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
Jacques Bernard: 'Brother,' said he, 'it is necessary
that your change of life should turn to the edification
of the people.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_507" id="Ref_507" href="#Foot_507">[507]</a></span>
Write down some propositions; announce
that you are ready to answer all men in a public
disputation, and defend your theses by clear and
manifest reasons. They would refuse us this favor, for
we are foreigners; but you are a citizen of Geneva,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_508" id="Ref_508" href="#Foot_508">[508]</a></span>
and superior of an important order. They will grant
your request.' The recent epoch of Bernard's conversion,
his want of Christian experience, the annoyances,
the dangers to which he would be exposed, might have
induced him to refuse this demand. But he knew that
in the new life on which he had entered, the rule was,
that every one, forgetful of himself, should work for the
good of others; and that with regard to his insufficiency,
God would provide. The head of the Cordeliers asked
the council's permission to maintain publicly the
evangelical doctrine in a conference to which all the
learned in the city and abroad should be invited. The
syndics, who desired that the Reformation should be accomplished
by reason and not by force, granted his
prayer, and everything was got ready for this important
action. For a long time Geneva had seen the parties
armed from head to foot, crossing their swords and
halberds: now minds were to be ranged in battle-array,
and the spiritual combat would, to all appearance,
decide the future of the Reformation.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER III.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">PREPARATION FOR A PUBLIC DISPUTATION AT GENEVA.<br />
 (<span class="smc">From April To Whitsuntide, 1535.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="side">=THE TEN PROPOSITIONS.=</p>

<p><span class="smc">Jacques Bernard</span> and the Reformers had a meeting
for the purpose of drawing up their propositions. The
justifying power of faith was to hold the first place, for,
according to the Gospel, man must, before everything,
condemn the selfish existence he has lived until the
moment of his awakening, and place all his confidence
in the redemption accomplished by Jesus Christ alone.
The theses drawn up by the Reformers were as follows:—</p>

<p>I. <i>Man must seek justification for his sins in Jesus
Christ</i> <span class="smc lc">ALONE</span>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_509" id="Ref_509" href="#Foot_509">[509]</a></span></p>

<p>II. <i>Religious worship must be paid to God</i> <span class="smc lc">ALONE</span>.</p>

<p>III. <i>The constitution of the Church must be regulated by
the Word of God</i> <span class="smc lc">ALONE</span>.</p>

<p>IV. <i>The atonement for sins must be ascribed to Christ's
sacrifice, offered up</i> <span class="smc lc">ONCE</span>, <i>and which procures full and entire
remission</i>.</p>

<p>V. <i>We must acknowledge</i> <span class="smc lc">ONE ONLY</span> <i>Mediator between
God and man—Jesus Christ</i>.</p>

<p>The fault of Rome had been to add to the Gospel
many strange dogmas and ceremonies, and place them
above the primitive edifice, stage after stage, pile after
pile, thus crushing it: this is indeed the proper meaning
conveyed by the word superstition. The Reformers aspired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
to pull down this framework, and liberate
Christian truth from all the fables by which it was disfigured.
Hence, as we see, the word <i>alone</i> plays a great
part in this disputation. Its object was to exclude all
human additions and to exalt God alone, Christ alone,
the Gospel alone. These propositions, however, did not
entirely satisfy Farel. In his opinion it was necessary,
after laying down truths, to point out errors. Five
negative theses were, therefore, added to the five positive
theses:—</p>

<p>VI. <i>It is wrong to put our trust in good works and look
for our justification in them.</i></p>

<p>VII. <i>To worship saints and images is to be guilty of
idolatry.</i></p>

<p>VIII. <i>Hence our traditions and ecclesiastical (or rather
Roman) constitutions are not only useless but pernicious.</i></p>

<p>IX. <i>The sacrifice of the mass, and prayers to the dead or
for them, are a sin against the Word of God, and men are
wrong to look to them for salvation.</i></p>

<p>X. <i>The intercession of saints was introduced into the
Church by the authority of men and not of God.</i></p>

<p>These propositions seem to us now mere theological
formulæ: they were more than that. There was the
true spirit in them. 'There are different ways of speaking,'
said the friend<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_510" id="Ref_510" href="#Foot_510">[510]</a></span>
 to whom Farel wrote an account
of this disputation; 'the roaring of a lion is different
from the braying of an ass.' There was indeed in these
theses, destined to throw down a whole world of errors,
the formidable 'roaring of a lion.'</p>

<p>On the 23d of April Jacques Bernard went to the
hôtel-de-ville and presented his propositions to the
council, who authorized him to defend them, and desired
him to inform the members of the chapter of St. Pierre
and other priests, monks, and doctors.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_511" id="Ref_511" href="#Foot_511">[511]</a></span>
At Constance,
freedom of discussion had been suppressed; and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
assembly, therefore, had produced no other light than
the flames of the scaffold. It was not thus that the
Reformation was to advance. 'Let the truth appear
and triumph!'</p>

<p>The theses were immediately distributed in all the
churches and monasteries of the city. No worshipper
crossed the threshold of the sanctuary without receiving
one of the printed handbills. The superior of the
Franciscans waited personally upon the canons and presented
each of them with a copy of the propositions.
He gave them to every member of the government, lay
and clerical: there was no shop or refectory in which
the ten propositions were not read and commented
upon. They were posted on the church doors and in
the public places, not only in Geneva, but in the allied
and neighboring cities. They were even sent to gentlemen
at their châteaux. In its very infancy, the Reformation
proclaimed and practised the widest publicity.
The trumpet sounded in every quarter of the city, and
the herald announced that a discussion would take place
on the 30th of May in the great hall of the Cordeliers of
Rive, and that scholars of all classes, Genevese or
foreigners, clerks or laymen, were invited with full
liberty of speaking, and the offer of a safe-conduct.
'Ah!' said Froment, one of the champions, 'if such a
license were given by every prince, the business would
be soon settled, without burning so many poor Christians.
But the pope and his cardinals forbid all discussion
of this or that, except it be with fire and sword: a
fashion they have learnt no doubt from the Grand
Seignor.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_512" id="Ref_512" href="#Foot_512">[512]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ALARM OF THE PAPISTS.=</p>

<p>The remark was but too true. The news of the
discussion had no sooner reached the bishop than a
feeling of horror came over him. 'What!' he said,
'convoke a council in my own city! nobody has the
right to do it but myself.' And he immediately published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
throughout his diocese a proclamation 'forbidding
the faithful to be present at the assembly under pain of
excommunication.' The duke of Savoy also forbade his
subjects to attend it, and the Franciscans, at that time
assembled in general chapter at Grenoble, having received
the invitation, declared they would not come.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_513" id="Ref_513" href="#Foot_513">[513]</a></span>
There were, no doubt, capable men among them; but to
discuss the truths taught by the Church was, in their
eyes, aiming a blow at its authority. The result was
a universal silence on the part of the priests. They
were very clever in making the most of miraculous appearances,
of dead children restored to life; but of discussion,
not a word. One or two fervent Catholics
would, however, have willingly broken a lance with
Farel, but the orders of their chiefs held them back.
The army of the pope, summoned by the voice of the
trumpet, was wanting on the day of combat.</p>

<p>Still Roman-catholicism did something. Monsignor
de Bonmont went to the council on the 25th of May,
and begged the syndics to take part in a torchlight
procession and other ceremonies which were to take
place on the 27th of the month, the festival of Corpus
Christi. That procession, however brilliant it might
be, was very displeasing to the zealous Reformers:
they did not like that the Word of God should be supplanted
by millinery, lace, and all the empty glitter
which dazzles the eye in sacerdotal costumes. The
answer of the council was judicious: 'We have appointed
a discussion,' said the premier syndic to the
vicar-episcopal; 'that will decide whether the procession
is holy or not. Wait a little, then; if the conference
is in favor of the procession, it shall be proclaimed
with sound of trumpet.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_514" id="Ref_514" href="#Foot_514">[514]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time the council resolved to send a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
deputation to all the convents to invite the monks,
who answered, 'We have no learned men among us;
it is impossible for us to take part in the discussion.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_515" id="Ref_515" href="#Foot_515">[515]</a></span></p>

<p>One convent, however, displayed resolution: it was
that of the nuns of Ste. Claire. The mother-vicar,
Mademoiselle de Montluet de Château-Fort, a woman
of warm and fiery temperament, answered the invitation:
'Begone! you are wicked people who want to
vex the servants of God.' The deputies replied, 'It
is said, madam, that certain of your nuns remain only
by force under your instruction, and would like to hear
the voice of the Good Shepherd.'... At these words
the mother-vicar burst out. 'Satan has no part among
us,' she cried; and turning towards the nuns, added,
'My sisters, speak, speak!' Almost all exclaimed at the
top of their voices, 'We will live and die in our holy calling.'
The clamor was so great that the deputies could not
make themselves heard. 'Do not be afraid, gentlemen,'
said the mother, 'this is nothing. You will hear something
very different if you take us to your <i>synagogue</i>.
When we are there, we will make such an uproar, that
we shall remain mistresses of the place.' 'Dame vicar,'
said a deputy, 'you are very arrogant.' Thereupon the
gentlemen retired, acknowledging however that they
had not witnessed such courage in the convents of the
monks.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_516" id="Ref_516" href="#Foot_516">[516]</a></span></p>

<p>Farel, who was distressed at seeing the priests of
Geneva refuse the discussion, would have supplied their
place by distinguished athletes belonging to one party
or the other. He wrote to Lefèvre of Etaples, the celebrated
doctor of the Sorbonne, and invited him to the
combat in which liberty and truth were about to engage
in Geneva.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_517" id="Ref_517" href="#Foot_517">[517]</a></span>
The aged and venerable doctor shed tears,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
and returned thanks to God for what he heard.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_518" id="Ref_518" href="#Foot_518">[518]</a></span>
But
he was too old to take part in a disputation; perhaps,
too, his faith was not bold enough; he declined the
invitation. Farel turned his eyes in another direction.
A chapter of the order of St. Francis was at that time
sitting at Lyons, its president being Pierre de Corne, or
<i>de Cornibus</i>, the most intrepid adversary of the heretics,
the butt of Rabelais' jests and of some unbelieving
worldlings, but highly extolled by the devout, and
especially by Loyola's friend, Francis Xavier. Farel
pressed De Cornibus to come to Geneva; the reformer
could not give a plainer proof of the seriousness of his
intentions and the impartiality of the discussion. 'I am
quite ready to break a lance in Geneva,' wrote De
Cornibus. The council were highly delighted with this
answer, and prepared to receive the warlike doctor with
great honor. But all of a sudden De Cornibus informed
them that he could not come.</p>

<p>If the combatants were not to be very numerous, the
spectators at least were crowding in from all sides—men
and women, great and small. Everybody wanted to see
and hear, but nobody was willing to speak. The reformers
were in despair, lest the dialogue should be
turned into a monologue, and instead of a grand combat,
one army alone should appear on the field of
battle.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_519" id="Ref_519" href="#Foot_519">[519]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CAROLI AT GENEVA.=</p>

<p>An unexpected help now appeared. A doctor of the
Sorbonne, named Caroli, arrived in Geneva and declared
himself ready to dispute. Possessing insupportable
vanity, tossing his head as he walked along the
street, assuming a haughty and impudent air with
everybody, the Parisian doctor made a great stir, talked
incessantly, aped the gentleman, and boasted loudly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
Much taken up with himself, he sought marks of honor,
and to obtain them employed cunning, artifice, and
intrigue. He represented himself to be, or allowed
others to call him, <i>bishop</i>. 'Have you heard,' said the
citizens, 'that a bishop has arrived from France?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_520" id="Ref_520" href="#Foot_520">[520]</a></span>
Everybody thought that Farel had found his man at
last. But the reformer, who had known him long,
shook his head. The foolish admiration which Caroli
felt for his own person had drawn upon him the
contempt of those who were not to be deceived by his
braggadocio. The reformer knew that he was fluent
of tongue, but was without firm principle, uprightness,
or solid character, and that his sole desire was to make
a name—whether in the Roman or in the evangelical
camp mattered little to him. He was known to unite
and to quarrel with everybody in turn. He was neither
catholic nor reformer, but simply Caroli. As skilful as
the famous Beda in the tricks of sophistry, he had
disputed in Paris with that illustrious champion; and
the Sorbonne having interdicted him, Margaret of Valois
looked upon him as a victim of the Gospel, and gave him
the living of Alençon. He had come from that city to
Geneva, where nobody had expected or wanted him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_521" id="Ref_521" href="#Foot_521">[521]</a></span>
It was rumored abroad that there would be a great stir
in the city; and Caroli, who had 'a keen scent' (to use
the words of a contemporary), thought that Geneva
would be a theatre where he might display his profound
learning and fine voice, and gather fresh laurels to
adorn his brow. There was only one point about which
he still hesitated: should he take the side of Rome or of
the Reformation?</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL REBUKES CAROLI.=</p>

<p>Farel liked not those ambiguous characters who hoist
one flag or another according to the place they may be
at. Catholic at Paris, Erasmian at Alençon, Caroli
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
would probably be a reformer at Geneva. Farel went
to his inn, where he found him at breakfast. Entering
upon business immediately, the reformer said to him
frankly: 'You are driven from France for the faith, you
say; certainly you have not deserved it, for you have
done nothing that was unworthy of the pope or worthy
of Jesus Christ.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_522" id="Ref_522" href="#Foot_522">[522]</a></span>
The doctor of the Sorbonne, offended
by such words, held his tongue and continued his meal.
'The song I sang him while he was at breakfast,' said
Farel, 'did not seem to please him much.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_523" id="Ref_523" href="#Foot_523">[523]</a></span>
'Are you
willing now,' resumed Farel, 'to confess the truth openly,
as God requires, and to repair the evil that you have
done by your dissimulation?' The Parisian doctor
cleverly turned the conversation and began to parade a
great zeal for the poor. 'I am going to send my servant
back to France,' he said, 'to receive the money from my
benefices, and I shall distribute it among your poor refugees.'
Farel remembered how certain monks in Paris
had made a great display about a collection in favor of
the poor, not a penny of which had the latter ever seen.
'God,' he said, 'will never fail either the poor or us.
Let us now give the bread of the Word to men's
souls,' and left him. Several days elapsed. Caroli
compensated himself for the humiliation Farel had inflicted
upon him by representing himself everywhere as
one of the greatest orators of France; and accordingly
all the Genevans wanted to hear him. 'Let us put him
to the test,' said Farel, who asked him to preach. But
Caroli, no doubt fearing the proof, urged a thousand
excuses to get off. 'Your sermons charm me,' he said
to Farel, 'and I cannot persuade myself not to hear
them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_524" id="Ref_524" href="#Foot_524">[524]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></div>

<p>This braggart priest, who pretended to support the
refugees, was living upon them, extorting their money,
wine, and other things. 'Our master,' said one of them
to Farel, 'behaves very theologically: he uses wine
magisterially, and even Sorbonically.' The reputation of
certain doctors of the Sorbonne was established on that
point. 'He has women to make his bed,' they added,
'to pull off his stockings, and even for other familiarities.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_525" id="Ref_525" href="#Foot_525">[525]</a></span>
The wretched man imagined that, coming into a
country which rejected the law of the pope, he could
throw off the law of God. Farel, assured of the truth
of these reports, visited this vain and impure priest,
spoke to him of his dissolute life, reminded him of the
judgment of the Lord, and entreated him to change his
conduct. Farel spoke with so much authority, that all
who were present were struck with it. The Sorbonne
doctor was confounded: he hid his face in his hands,
and did not open his mouth. From that time he behaved
more prudently, and did nothing (openly, at
least) that could be charged against him. He had his
reasons for not quarrelling with the reformers.</p>

<p>Jacques Bernard, who had but recently thrown off
the cowl, was not so clear-sighted as Farel; Caroli tried,
therefore, to throw dust into his eyes. He hinted that,
as a doctor of the Sorbonne of Paris, celebrated by
former struggles with the most illustrious doctors, he
was well qualified to be appointed arbiter in the disputation,
and invited to pronounce authoritatively the final
judgment.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_526" id="Ref_526" href="#Foot_526">[526]</a></span>
Thus, becoming umpire between Geneva
and Rome, he already fancied himself the most important
person of Christendom. The simple-minded
Bernard, circumvented by the artifices of the wily
Frenchman, consented to make the strange proposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
to Farel.—'No,' at once answered the reformer; 'it is
to God and to Holy Scripture that we must pay supreme
honor. We do not want men as judges of our controversy:
the Lord is the only judge, who will decide
authoritatively by the Scriptures. That presumptuous
man would only seek his own glorification in the dispute.'
The magistrates supported this opinion.</p>

<p class="side">=THE DEBATE PROCLAIMED.=</p>

<p>In fact, the council, finding itself between two confessions—one
coming, and one departing—regarded
itself as mediator, and wished to see which was right or
wrong; then, if there were cause, to do as certain good
kings of Israel and Judah had done—'extirpate the
idolatry of their people.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_527" id="Ref_527" href="#Foot_527">[527]</a></span>
Placed at the head of the
republic, the magistracy did not understand that
religious matters, so important at that period, were not
within its jurisdiction; and even when the question
was decided somewhat later, when the firm Calvin was
established at Geneva, the State continued to hold
under its jurisdiction all matters which are considered
in this day as belonging to the Church. The council,
therefore, nominated eight commissioners, empowered
to regulate the discussion, and chose them from among
the most respected leaders of the people: four belonged
to the catholic party,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_528" id="Ref_528" href="#Foot_528">[528]</a></span>
and four to the reformed opinions;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_529" id="Ref_529" href="#Foot_529">[529]</a></span>
all of them had been syndics. The council,
moreover, named four secretaries, belonging to the two
parties, and instructed them to draw up the minutes.
The discussion was proclaimed by sound of trumpet,
and it was published everywhere, that the disputation
would be entirely free. Then, fearing lest the enemy
should take advantage of the opportunity to attack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
Geneva, the syndics bade the captain-general 'keep
careful watch and ward at the gates, towers, and ramparts,
and prevent any disturbance taking place in the
city.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_530" id="Ref_530" href="#Foot_530">[530]</a></span></p>

 <h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE GREAT PUBLIC DEBATE ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE
 EVANGELICAL FAITH.<br />
 (<span class="smc">June 1535.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">Sunday,</span> the 30th of May and the feast of Pentecost,
the day on which the discussion was to begin, came at
last. A year had passed away since the Reformation
had made its public entrance into Geneva; it was now
about to take another step—one that would secure its
triumph. The day of Pentecost, so important for the
establishment of Christianity, was to be important also
for the Reformation. The same Spirit which had begun
the Church, is also that which will renew it when it has
fallen. Friends and enemies crowded that day to the
convent of Rive, animated with the liveliest and most
opposite emotions. Nothing had been spared so that
the debate should take place with solemnity. 'A
theatre,' that is to say, a platform, had been erected in
the great hall. The eight commissioners took their
seats, and an immense concourse of Genevans and
foreigners filled the vast auditory. A table had been
placed in the <i>arena</i> for the combatants. Jacques Bernard
appeared first: he was followed by Farel, Viret,
and Froment; but the places set apart for the champions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
of the Roman Church remained unoccupied, and
people began to ask if Rome would fail to appear. At
last two ecclesiastics came forward: one was Chapuis,
prior of the Dominican convent, the most learned man
at that time in Geneva; the other was Caroli, the Sorbonne
doctor.</p>

<p class="side">=BERNARD AND CHAPUIS.=</p>

<p>Bernard spoke first. He undertook to prove that, in
the Romish Church, men did not look to Christ for justification
from their sins, and for that purpose put in the
rules of his order, and showed how the monks claimed
to be saved by their vain practices, and gave themselves
up to pride, avarice, and even to great impurity. He
spoke from personal knowledge. A man of upright
heart, quick, a little violent even, he repelled with
energy the disorders in which he had once taken part.
Standing in the great hall of his own convent, the guardian
pulled down what he had worshipped and worshipped
what he had pulled down. This made the
father-confessor of Ste. Claire exclaim: 'How that
accursed Jacques Bernard despises the frock he once
wore.' Chapuis, the Dominican, came forward resolutely
in defence of the monastic orders, and reproved the
guardian severely. Farel rose in support of Bernard,
but Chapuis, who feared such an adversary, maintained
that nobody but Bernard ought to answer him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_531" id="Ref_531" href="#Foot_531">[531]</a></span>
The
next day Bernard and Chapuis, the heads of the two
great convents of Geneva, met again; but Chapuis
received orders from his Provincial to leave the city
immediately.</p>

<p>This vexed the magistrates exceedingly: they remembered
Furbity, and the excessive zeal which had
caused his imprisonment: they had no doubt that he
would joyfully seize the opportunity of defending the
faith of Rome. Having sent for the jailer's wife, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
ordered her to place the articles under dispute in the
reverend father's hands. As she was a zealous Roman-catholic,
and on good terms with Furbity, they thought
that he would receive them more willingly from her than
from her husband, who was ardent for the reform. The
woman, a timid soul, was afraid of everybody: of her
husband, whom she did not wish to displease by
neglecting the commission, and of the reverend father,
whom she feared to offend by giving him the heretical
propositions; so she sent them by one of the turnkeys.
'Alas!' exclaimed Furbity, 'even my poor hostess is
trying to seduce me.' He tossed the paper out of his
cell. The jaileress sent it back to him by her little girl;
but the latter, who was harshly received, brought it
back to her mother, who, frightened at the probability
of displeasing their worships, slipped the theses into the
cell by the window. The reverend father, seeing the
paper which he had cursed falling at his feet, picked it
up, tore it to pieces, and trampled it under foot.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_532" id="Ref_532" href="#Foot_532">[532]</a></span>
All
hope of seeing him defend popery had to be given up.</p>

<p>The disputation began again without him. Bernard
and Farel, having Caroli for respondent, showed by
Scripture that Jesus Christ alone saves men from sin.
Caroli was very weak, but hinted to his partisans that
he reserved his hardest blows till the last, and would
then pound his adversaries to powder. He did not
speak up for either side. The honest Viret, indignant
at such trickery, attacked him so skilfully, that he was
constrained to pronounce for or against the truth. The
Sorbonnist took the side of the reformers. 'All the
efforts of man are in vain,' he said. 'Without the grace
of Christ, he can neither begin what is good, nor pursue
it, nor persevere.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_533" id="Ref_533" href="#Foot_533">[533]</a></span>
'Very good,' exclaimed Farel;
'thank you, doctor. The glory of God and the edification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
of the people, is all we desire.' Caroli was quite
proud of having spoken so well.</p>

<p class="side">=FURBITY INVITED TO DEBATE.=</p>

<p>The reformers were again without antagonists, Caroli
appearing to agree with them. The magistrates returned
to their notion about Furbity, and as Caroli had
been his theological tutor in Paris, the Council asked
him to invite his old pupil to come and defend his doctrine,
or to disavow his errors as he himself had done.
'Willingly,' said the vainglorious doctor. After dinner,
the four syndics, the great Parisian doctor, that <i>Satan</i>
William Farel (as Sister Jeanne calls him), Pierre Viret,
and several of their friends, went to the prison. The
Dominican appeared: he was thin, weak, debilitated,
and his feet tottered, so that when he saw the Sorbonne
doctor in the company of all those heretics, he fell
fainting to the ground.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_534" id="Ref_534" href="#Foot_534">[534]</a></span>
They lifted him up, and when
he had recovered his senses, Caroli, addressing him in a
doctoral tone, said: 'How is this, brother Guy; will you
die in your obstinacy—in your errors, now that we have
arrived at the truth? Acknowledge that you have been
deceived, and return to God.' Furbity, divided between
respect for his old teacher and fidelity to the pope, exclaimed:
'God forbid that I should quarrel with my
master.... I desire to die in the truth as I learnt it
of you.'—'Come, then, and defend it,' they said. But
Furbity imposed a singular condition: he required
Farel's beard to be cut off. We know that the bigots
believed in the existence of a devil in each hair of the
reformer's beard. 'If I must dispute with that idiot,'
he exclaimed, 'let the dwelling of his master the devil
be first cleared away, and all his skin shaved.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_535" id="Ref_535" href="#Foot_535">[535]</a></span>
They
urged the doctor to no purpose: nothing could shake
him. No beard or no discussion.</p>

<p>The debate began again, and that day Caroli was
Roman-catholic from head to foot. Bernard maintained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
that Christ was the only mediator; Caroli affirmed that
it was Mary. 'The Virgin having remained upon earth,
after the death of the Saviour,' he said, 'the mother
naturally succeeded the Son.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_536" id="Ref_536" href="#Foot_536">[536]</a></span>—'Mary,
the successor to
her Son!' exclaimed Farel. 'Let us have done with
these foolish questions: let us get out of this labyrinth
of quibbling which men call <i>Roman theology</i>.' It was
agreed that the discussion next day should turn upon
the Mass.</p>

<p>Caroli, determining to arm himself completely to defend
this palladium of popery, spent a portion of the
night in hunting over huge folios,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_537" id="Ref_537" href="#Foot_537">[537]</a></span>
and in taking notes
of the reasons that might be adduced in favor of that
sacrifice. The <i>Mysteria Missæ</i> of Innocent III., the
<i>Summa Theologiæ</i> of Thomas Aquinas, the <i>Sentences of
Bonaventure</i>, were in turn examined by him. The next
day he began to pour out the arguments he had hastily
collected. 'Firstly,' he said; 'secondly'.... But he
lost the thread and stopped short, continuing to repeat
the same words. The scholar forgot his lesson. To
complete the comedy, it only wanted Farel to prompt
the arguments which he had forgotten. 'You mean to
say this or to say that,' suggested the reformer.—'Yes,
yes,' said the poor doctor, 'it is exactly what I meant
to say.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_538" id="Ref_538" href="#Foot_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>Caroli, piqued at this triumph of Farel's, made an
effort, and getting once more into the saddle, began
to prance about valiantly. 'Really,' said Froment, who
heard him, he now argues with subtlety and great earnestness.'
The catholics, without waiting for the reformer's
answer, ran off to the canons: 'The Parisian
doctor is speaking admirably,' they said. The canons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
ordered some of their best wine to be taken to him.
Caroli was at this moment the happiest man in the
world; the papacy and the Reformation both lavished
their favors on him at once.</p>

<p>The next day the audience was more numerous than
usual: the doctor's eloquence had been much talked
about, and the catholics came in crowds. Sworn enemies
of Reform<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_539" id="Ref_539" href="#Foot_539">[539]</a></span>
said to one another, 'Let us go and witness
the triumph of the divine mysteries of popery.' That
day the points to be defended were transubstantiation,
the sacrifice of the mass, the adoration of the bread,
the taking away of the cup, the invocation of saints,
the use of a foreign tongue, and other rites and customs.
Caroli, puffed up by the good position he had acquired,
tossed his head and challenged his adversaries in a loud
tone: 'Give me a man who shows himself a man,' he
said, 'and we will fight together.' Then stood forward
to answer him a mere boy. When the veteran doctor
saw this novice, so puny in body,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_540" id="Ref_540" href="#Foot_540">[540]</a></span>
he despised him as
Goliath despised David. 'Surely,' he said, 'you do not
mean to pass him off for one of your pastors!' This
young man was Pierre Viret, then twenty-four years
old, whose health was still weakened by the poison,
and who had such a pale face and weak look that he
seemed ready to faint. 'Alas!' he said of himself, 'I
am but a mere bag of bones.' His language showed
little color or elegance: but he had a logical style,
perfectly clear, the skill of an orator, and all accompanied
by an indescribable sweetness and charm.</p>

<p class="side">=TRIUMPH OF REFORM.=</p>

<p>The two champions joined in combat; and Viret
refuted Caroli's assertions so clearly and so completely,
that all the spectators took his side.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_541" id="Ref_541" href="#Foot_541">[541]</a></span>
Caroli, not
knowing what to say, began to vociferate a long 'Bah!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
bah! bah!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_542" id="Ref_542" href="#Foot_542">[542]</a></span>
It was useless for Viret to adduce the
most solid reasons, the Sorbonne doctor could find no
other argument than that foolish interjection. 'What
do I hear?' exclaimed Farel; 'we should blush to
answer in such a manner.' Caroli held his tongue, and
some catholics began to ask themselves whether the
doctrines they had held for sacred might not be merely
the opinions of men.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_543" id="Ref_543" href="#Foot_543">[543]</a></span></p>

<p>Quitting this part of the subject, the doctor proceeded
to defend the forms of popery. 'How much more august
is the service,' he said, 'if it is celebrated in Latin!
What majesty there is in the Roman ceremonies! The
tonsure of the priests is a crown to them.'—'It is
Christ's wish,' said Farel, 'that leaving shadows, we
should worship the Father in spirit and in truth. If we
load the Church with ceremonies, signs, and ornaments,
we rob it of the presence of Jesus Christ. If King
Hezekiah broke the brazen serpent, what must be done
with all these superstitions, which surpass the idolatry
of the Jews in scandal?'</p>

<p>It was too much. The bishop, informed of the
progress of the discussion, issued from Arbois on the
13th of June, in the very midst of the debates, an order,
'forbidding people of every condition to be from that
day forward so bold and daring as to speak or trade with
the syndics, preachers, and citizens of Geneva, under
pain of excommunication and a fine of twenty-five
livres.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_544" id="Ref_544" href="#Foot_544">[544]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the bishop set up a quarantine to separate
Geneva from Christendom; but it was precisely at this
epoch that the obscure city of the Allobroges came into
communication with the world, and spread abroad the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
light which it had received. While the papacy ceased
to utter its oracles there, and had in its service none but
the dumb, the Word of God made its loud and mighty
voice heard through the mouths of the Reformers.
Such was the result of the discussion. 'In that controversy,'
says a modern historian who does not belong to
the Reform, 'the catholics were defeated by the
reformers.'<span

 <h3>CHAPTER V.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">TRIUMPH OF THE WORD OF GOD, BOTH WRITTEN AND SPOKEN.<br />
 (<span class="smc">June to August 1535.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">Rome</span> had set up, beside the Bible and even above it,
the word and the traditions of men. The Reformation
demanded that the Holy Scriptures should be read by
all and preached from the pulpits. The written Word
and oral teaching were to displace that pretended
infallible chair, which alone was authorized (they said)
to set forth the will of God.</p>

<p class="side">=THE FRENCH BIBLE PRINTED.=</p>

<p>One fact of great importance was being accomplished
at this time. The discussion maintained at Geneva
by Farel, Bernard, Chapuis, and Caroli was but a
musketry skirmish; but at a little distance from that
city—at Neuchâtel—thanks to the labors of Calvin and
Olivetan, a tradesman, a Picard like themselves, was
preparing that great artillery, whose formidable volleys
were to break down the walls of error, on the ruins of
which a divine hand was to establish the truth of
Jesus Christ.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></div>

<p>Pierre Robert of Noyon, called Olivetan, had finished
the work the Church had intrusted to him. On the
4th of June, 1535, appeared the first French Bible of
the Reformation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_546" id="Ref_546" href="#Foot_546">[546]</a></span>
'Possessing a keen and penetrating
mind,' said one of its readers who was thoroughly capable
of appreciating the work, 'the translator is not deficient
in learning; he has spared neither labor, research,
nor care, and has ably discharged the duties of a translator
of the Bible.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_547" id="Ref_547" href="#Foot_547">[547]</a></span>
'I have done the best I could,' said
the translator himself, on presenting the book to his
brethren; 'I have labored and searched as deeply as I
possibly could into the living mine of pure truth; but I
do not pretend to have entirely exhausted it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_548" id="Ref_548" href="#Foot_548">[548]</a></span>
Some
people have asserted that Olivetan's Bible was only a
copy of that by Le Fevre of Etaples. The translation of
the Old Testament, probably begun before Olivetan's
journey to the Valleys, is the best part of his work, and
it may be said to be original.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_549" id="Ref_549" href="#Foot_549">[549]</a></span>
Calvin's cousin no doubt
had his predecessor's translation before him; but the
latter does not contain three consecutive verses in which
Olivetan has not changed something. His New Testament
is more like Le Fevre's; still numerous changes
were introduced into it. It has been calculated that the
new translator had corrected the biblical text of the
Sorbonne doctor in twenty-three thousand five hundred
places, and in more than sixty thousand, if account be
taken of all the minutiæ of style.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_550" id="Ref_550" href="#Foot_550">[550]</a></span>
Calvin's share has
reference particularly to the later editions of this Bible.
With regard to the mechanical part, the two cousins
had found a distinguished auxiliary.</p>

<p>Pierre de Wingle (called also Pérot Picard) was one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
of the good printers of the sixteenth century. The
episcopal court of Lyons, where he lived, had prosecuted
him for printing 'certain writings come from Germany;'
he then took refuge at Geneva, but the impression of
the New Testament and various pamphlets had compelled
him, in 1532, to flee to Neuchâtel—a reformed
city since 1530—which behaved more hospitably, and
shortly after made him a citizen. About half an hour's
walk from Neuchâtel, is the little village of Serrière;
here Wingle set up his presses, and this modest but
happy locality, which first had heard the Gospel
preached by Farel, was destined also to be the first to
witness the birth of Olivetan's Bible. The latter had
dated his dedication,</p>

<p class="center small"><i>Des Alpes, ce</i> XIIᵉ <i>de feburier 1535</i>,</p>

<p class="nodent">as if he wished to confound the Vaudois valleys of the
Cottian Alps, where the idea had been conceived, with
the parts of Switzerland where it had been carried out.
The Vaudois had collected for this publication five hundred
golden crowns, a sum equivalent to about 2,400<i>l.</i>
sterling.</p>

<p class="side">=OLIVETAN TO THE CHURCH.=</p>

<p>The volume had scarcely left the press, when Wingle
and his friends sent it wherever the French language
was spoken. 'Has not the King of kings proclaimed,'
they thought, 'that His <i>Word should go forth to the ends
of the world</i>?' 'The people who make thee this present,'
said Olivetan to the Church, 'are the true people of
patience who, in silence and hope, have overcome all
assaults. For a long time they have seen thee maltreated,
seeming rather a poor slave than the daughter
and heiress of the universal Ruler. But now that thou
beginnest to recognize thy origin, these people, thy
brothers, come forward and lovingly offer thee their all.
Cheer up then, poor little Church! go and cleanse thy
spattered rags; go and wash thy befouled hands. Desirest
thou to be always subject to masters? Is it not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
time to think of the Bridegroom? Here is a precious
jewel He sends thee as a wedding-gift and pledge of a
loyal marriage.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_551" id="Ref_551" href="#Foot_551">[551]</a></span>
Art thou afraid that He will some day
leave thee a widow, He who lives for evermore? Courage!
bid farewell to that traitorous hag whom thou hast
so long called mother. It is true that thou canst bring
to thy husband nothing of any value; but come, come
boldly with all the nobles and titled ones of thy court,
with thy insulted, excommunicated, imprisoned, banished,
and plundered ones! Come with thy tortured,
branded, crop-eared, dismembered ones!<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_552" id="Ref_552" href="#Foot_552">[552]</a></span>
Such are
those whom Christ calls to triumph with him in his
heavenly court.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_553" id="Ref_553" href="#Foot_553">[553]</a></span></p>

<p>If the fruits of the Bible published at Neuchâtel were
more numerous, those of the discussion at Geneva were
more prompt. The most candid catholics were struck
at seeing the men who were on the side of the Reform
giving an account of their faith, while those on the other
side stood dumb. There was eloquence in this contrast.
Accordingly priests, laymen, and women, stripped of
their prejudices, declared that the truth of God, brought
forward during the discussion, had opened their eyes.
No doubt many simply quitted the forms of popery for
the forms of protestantism. To put aside superstitions,
to break images, and to reject the authority of the pope
was in their eyes the Reform: their chief was Ami
Perrin. But with a great number of Genevans, the
movement within, the conversion of the heart, corresponded
with the movement without. There were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
rivers of running water in that city which no man could
stop, and at which many quenched their thirst.</p>

<p class="side">=DELAYS IN THE COUNCIL.=</p>

<p>The magistrates, however, far from reforming the
Roman worship, remained motionless and silent. The
friends of the Gospel took the initiative. Claude Bernard,
the brother of Jacques, one of the captains of
the city, a man full of zeal for the truth, went before
the council on June 28th, accompanied by the ministers
and several notables, and represented that the
mass, images, and other inventions and idolatries,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_554" id="Ref_554" href="#Foot_554">[554]</a></span>
being contrary to Holy Scripture, as the disputation
had showed, it was time they were suppressed. The
law of conscience ought to become the law of the
State also. Bernard said: 'Ought a father to permit
the children whose guardianship God has intrusted to
him, to become attached to errors opposed to the
truth of God? Magistrates, act like fathers. It
will be to the glory of God and the salvation of the
people.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_555" id="Ref_555" href="#Foot_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>The syndics and councils could not come to a decision.
The step they were asked to take was that
of a giant. They feared to excite the catholics to take
up arms, and the duke of Savoy to surround Geneva
with his artillery. To cross definitively the line which
separated the old times from the new was too much for
them. St. Paul and the Apostles had done it in their
day, and the reformers were doing it now; but the
syndics of Geneva were neither Pauls nor Farels. They
feared civil war and escalades; they preferred waiting
for the Reform to be accomplished without them, for
everything to be changed without any one's observing
it. The council, therefore, procrastinated and did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
nothing.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_556" id="Ref_556" href="#Foot_556">[556]</a></span>
'The minutes of the discussion take a long
time arranging,' answered the premier syndic to Claude
Bernard; 'as soon as they are drawn out, we will see
what is to be done.' The great evolution of the Reformation
was metamorphosed by these worthy ediles into
a question of drawing up minutes. To show their
love for the <i>status quo</i>, they condemned to three days'
imprisonment, on bread and water and the strappado,
a huguenot who had destroyed the images placed in
front of the chapel of Notre Dame.</p>

<p>Farel's friends determined to wait; but no measure
of reform appeared, although they waited ten times
the space required to examine the minutes. The
huguenots thought that the council was taking refuge
in 'tortuous hiding-places,' when it ought to act boldly
in the light of day. The evangelicals thought that
'as God gives us everything openly, the secrets of our
hearts ought also to be open and displayed.'</p>

<p>Never had courage and firmness been more necessary.
Great miseries were beginning. Since the disputation
not a sack of wheat or a load of wood had
entered the city, while previously they used to enter in
great numbers twice a week. There were no eggs, or
butter, or cheese, or cattle. One day, however, a cow
was brought by a man from a neighboring village;
what a supply for a whole city! But the man had
scarcely got out of the city, when the enemy seized him
roughly and made him pay three times the price he
had received. If friends wanted to bring some trifling
stores from the nearest farms, they dared not do it by
daylight.<span

Finding themselves reduced to such extremities,
a few citizens on one or two occasions went
out of the city to procure bread: they were insulted
and beaten. 'Alas!' said the poor creatures, 'we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
have only to move the tips of our fingers, or go a nail's
breadth out of the city, to make our enemies cry out
that we are upsetting heaven and earth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_558" id="Ref_558" href="#Foot_558">[558]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing that no progress was made, the evangelicals
determined to assert the free publication of the Word
of God. It was not enough for them to have it printed,
they wanted it preached,—not only in their own houses
or in the great hall of Rive, but in the churches. They
had within their walls one of the most powerful
preachers of the age—Farel: they believed that their
duty towards God and their fellow-citizens called upon
them to make his eloquent voice heard by the multitude.</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL AT THE MADELEINE.=</p>

<p>The 22d of July was the feast of Mary Magdalen.
The bells had been solemnly rung to call worshippers
to the church of that name, and already a great number
of catholics and even evangelicals had gathered within
its walls. Was it by a Latin mass that the memory of
that Magdalen ought to be commemorated to whom
Jesus had said: <i>Thy faith hath saved thee</i>? Ought not
those words to be preached which Jesus had addressed
to her, and not the rubbish with which the priests sent
their flocks to sleep? This was what the reformers
asked each other. They observed, moreover, that the
catholics, less numerous than the protestants, had six
churches, while the latter had scarcely one or two
places of worship. They added that if the marvellous
work begun in Geneva was to be completed, great meetings
must be held in the temples. Some persons called
out, 'Farel.'—'Yes, Farel,' repeated many: 'let us go
and fetch him;' and they all ran to the convent of
Rive. The reformer had just gone into the pulpit when
the message was handed to him. Farel was always
ready and believed he had a right to speak in a church.
'My friends,' he said to his congregation, 'we must
to-day preach the good news under the vaulted roof of
the Madeleine, and abolish idolatry there.' He then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
came down from the pulpit and bent his way towards
that huge old gothic church, with its Carlovingian tower,
whose foundation dates from the eleventh century. The
crowd of his hearers followed him. He entered: his
friends made signs of joy: the priest standing before
the altar, where he was celebrating mass, stopped in
alarm and ran away; his acolytes followed him, and all
the worshippers wished to do the same. But the huguenots,
thinking that the Word of God was specially necessary
for them, shut the doors. This roused the catholics,
the frightened women shrieked, and all made such an
uproar, that the reformers opened the doors and let
those depart who pleased. There remained, however, a
certain number of undecided persons; and Farel began
to preach with power, that Saviour who had pardoned
the Magdalen and who still pardons sinners.</p>

<p>Meantime those who had fled, dispersing in the streets
and houses, cried out against the scandal, while the
parish priest, running off to the hôtel-de-ville, complained
to the council. Farel was forbidden to preach
again in that church. When the sermon was ended, the
catholics returned and the priests sang mass in it with
more fervor than ever. The huguenots made no opposition,
but they also claimed that no one should oppose
their meetings. The two worships were to be free. In
fact the very same day at vespers, 'those rascals
(<i>canailles</i>),' says Sister Jeanne, 'again took possession
of the holy church, and every day afterwards it was the
usual custom to preach in it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_559" id="Ref_559" href="#Foot_559">[559]</a></span></p>

<p>The irritated council summoned Farel before them on
the 30th of July. 'Sirs,' said the reformer, 'you have
yourselves acknowledged that whatever cannot be
proved by Scripture ought to be suppressed; why then
do you delay doing so? Were not the defenders of
popery vanquished in our debates? And has not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
almost the whole city recognized the finger of God in
this signal defeat of the papacy? Give us orders
which we can obey, for fear we should be constrained to
answer you with Scripture, that <i>it is better to obey God
rather than men</i>. Assemble the Council of Two Hundred
and let them decide.' The syndics, knowing that
the friends of Reform had a majority in that assembly,
refused the demand, and repeated their prohibition to
Farel, adding: <i>For good reasons</i>.</p>

<p>Farel thought their reasons bad. In such a matter
he knew but one really good: <i>Preach the Gospel to every
creature</i>, the Lord had said. He set no bounds either
to his desire for the triumph of the truth, or to his
expectation of help from God to give him the victory.
A holy ambition that would not be straitened, animated
him, and according to the words of Elisha, he <i>smote five
or six times</i> until the enemy was vanquished. Farel was
one of those men whom God raises up for great and
salutary revolutions: opposition only served to inflame
his courage.</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL AT SAINT-GERVAIS.=</p>

<p>On the 1st of August he went to Saint-Gervais, where
the friends of the Reform were numerous. The uneasy
syndics sent a guard of fifty men; but Farel went into
the pulpit and preached in the old church the ever new
Gospel of Jesus Christ. On the 5th of August he became
still bolder, and proclaimed the anti-Roman
doctrine in the church dedicated to St. Dominic, the
father of the Inquisition. This evangelist did not
perform his office at his own time only and according to
his own convenience: he never spared himself, whatever
were the vexations he gathered from his labors. He
summoned weary souls to rest at the feet of Christ; he
followed up the obstinate; he argued, reproved, entreated,
exhorted. He multiplied the inducements to
make the dilatory enter upon the way of life, and 'his
vehemence was always tempered with meekness.' The
hour had arrived when divine truth was to triumph over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
human errors; he therefore multiplied his attacks.
The greatest blow yet remained to be struck. A thunder-clap
was about to bring down an abundant rain
upon the thirsty earth, and the outpouring of the Holy
Ghost which cometh from heaven.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_560" id="Ref_560" href="#Foot_560">[560]</a></span></p>

<p>The cathedral of St. Pierre, whose three old towers
soar above the city, played a great part in its history,
and every Genevan was attached to its stones, though
they were now (as it were) broken and scattered, and
the divine service was contaminated by mournful profanations.
But the greater the desolation, the more did
pious men desire to see that august temple purified
and the good news proclaimed beneath its vaulted roof.
Fourteen canons still belonged to it, established to defend
it; but those unhappy clerks, isolated, scared, and
conquered before a blow was struck, waited trembling
until the tide of Reform, which still kept rising, invaded
their sanctuary. They had not long to wait. On
Sunday morning, 8th of August, a crowd of reformed
Genevans mounted the streets leading to the church,
and approached it with the firm intention of replacing
the light upon the candlestick. 'When rust has tarnished
iron,' said a reformer, 'we endeavor to restore
it to its former brightness: must we not, then, cleanse
away from the Church of Christ the thick rust which
ages of darkness have accumulated on it?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_561" id="Ref_561" href="#Foot_561">[561]</a></span>
Having
entered the noble edifice, the reformers began to ring
the great bell to call the people to hear the Gospel.
<i>Clémence</i> was tolling the last hour of the Middle
Ages, the <i>De Defunctis</i> of images, 'those gods of the
priests,' as the huguenots called them. The chapel
which contained the arm of St. Anthony, on which
men used to swear in serious cases, was to be pulled
down; all that mass of waxen hands offered by devotees,
and a thousand other relics equally stupid,
were to disappear. In that temple, now 'crammed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
with idols,' God and his Word were henceforward to
reign alone.</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL IN THE PULPIT.=</p>

<p>Farel arrived and went into the pulpit. The worship
they were about to celebrate was not to be an
ordinary service: a religious revolution was about to
be accomplished. Ceremonies were the essence of
popery. Now Farel was full of the idea that there
are no ceremonial laws in Christianity; that an act of
worship, discharged according to the rules of the
Church, is not on that account pleasing to God and
meritorious: that to overburden believers with festivals,
bowing of the head, crossing, kneeling before
pictures, and ceremonies, is opposed to worship in the
spirit; that to fill the churches with images, offerings,
relics, and tapers is dealing a blow at justification by
faith and the merit of Christ's death which alone save
the sinner. He believed with his whole heart that
divine worship, according to the New Testament,
does not consist in processions, elevations, salutations,
bowings, genuflexions before the host, and other superstitious
usages; that its essence is faith in the Gospel,
the charity which flows from it, patience in bearing the
cross, public confession of Jesus Christ, and the living
prayer of the heart. At the sight of the statues, the
pictures, the votive offerings which surrounded him—at
the recollection of the superstitious ceremonies
which for centuries had profaned that cathedral, Farel
in great emotion was ready to do anything, even at the
risk of his life, to establish that religion which is <i>spirit
and life</i>. 'Those idols,' he said, pointing from the
pulpit to the images around him, 'the mass and the
whole body of popery are condemned by the Holy
Ghost. The magistrates, ordained by God, ought to pull
down everything that is raised in opposition to God's
glory.' The images, if they remained, would be in his
eyes a sign of the victory of catholicism; but if they
fell, their fall would proclaim the victory of the Reformation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
This point had been often discussed: the
priests and devout people opposed Farel's intentions
with all their power, and maintained that such changes
required the consent of a general council. The alarmed
politicians objected that if they pulled down the images,
then for one enemy Geneva would have a hundred—the
duke of Savoy, the king of France, the emperor,
the pope, the cardinals, and all the bishops in the
world.</p>

<p>There were at this time two powers and two systems
in the city:—the reformers, whose ideal theories had
not yet been modified by reality, said that the State, as
well as individuals, ought to become a new creature;
that the Gospel would accomplish this work of transformation;
that the Church would change the people
and would make of the State a kingdom of God upon
earth.... Alas! that task is still far from being
accomplished, and can it ever be? On the other hand
the politicians, without wishing to reject the influence
of the Gospel, thought that the State occupied the first
place in human society, and that order was not possible
without it. They believed that the magistrates, without
being the masters of the faith, ought to be the
source of regularity in the Church, and accordingly the
State undertook to restrain the evangelicals. It was attempted
later in Calvin's day; now it was done in
Farel's. The council sent for him after the sermon at
St. Pierre's and asked him why he had preached in the
cathedral. 'I am surprised,' said the reformer, 'that
you make a crime of what is in accordance with Scripture.'
If, however, he rendered unto God the things that
were God's, he was willing to render unto Cæsar the
things that were Cæsar's. He therefore expressed a desire
that the reformers should be summoned by the
legitimate authority, and renewed his demand for the
convocation of the Council of Two Hundred.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></div>

<p>The syndics ordered him to discontinue his sermons at
St. Pierre's until further notice.<span

 <h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">IMAGES AND THE MASS ABOLISHED.<br />
 (<span class="smc">8th to 11th August 1535.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> Reformation protested against a ritualistic and
meritorious worship; against the multiplicity of feasts,
consecrations, ecclesiastical usages and customs; against
any adoration whatever rendered to creatures, images,
and relics; against the invocation of mediators who
usurped the function of the Son of God; lastly, and
chiefly, against a pretended expiatory sacrifice, effected
by the priests, which was substituted for the only sacrifice
offered by Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="side">=CHANTS OF THE PRIESTS.=</p>

<p>All these human vanities were about to disappear.
Farel and his friends waited for the reformatory ordinance;
but the ardent huguenots, among whom Ami
Perrin was the most active, became impatient at the
perpetual hesitations of the council. A chance event
called forth an energetic demonstration on their part.
The same Sunday (8th August) in the afternoon at vespers,
the canons, assembling again in their church,
chanted the Psalm <i>In exitu Israël</i>, 'When Israel went
out of Egypt,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_563" id="Ref_563" href="#Foot_563">[563]</a></span>
and, with the utmost simplicity, repeated
in Latin what Farel had said in the morning in French:</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">Simulacra gentium argentum et aurum,</div>
<div class="verse">Opera manuum hominum.</div>

<div class="verse">Similes illis fiant qui faciunt ea</div>

     class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_564" id="Ref_564" href="#Foot_564">[564]</a></span></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The canons could not have chosen a fitter text. Some
huguenots, who knew Latin better perhaps than they
did, smiled and called out: 'Ho there, you priests, you
curse in your chants those who made the images and
trusted in them, and yet you allow them to remain.'
They restrained themselves, however, for the moment.
The magistrates continued repeating, 'There is no need
to abolish the mass and images; else very formidable
princes will be to you like ravening wolves rushing upon
sheep.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_565" id="Ref_565" href="#Foot_565">[565]</a></span></p>

<p>A very extraordinary thing occurred at this moment.
Nobody was willing to begin the work and yet it was
accomplished. 'God,' said the reformers, 'who holds
the world in his hand, loves to choose the contemptible
rather than what is great and apparent.' In fact, it was
a mischievous jest of some children which dealt the first
blow. 'For this work,' says Froment, 'God stirred up
a score of little boys.' These children had often heard
the priests, and their errors and abuses spoken of; and
their parents had added that it was time they were
ended. They slipped into St. Pierre's; stopped and
listened, and were struck with the strange intonations of
the canons. Making their way towards a part of the
church remote from that in which the reverend fathers
were chanting, they began to play like boys of their age,
'while nobody thought anything about it,' says the
chronicler. They commenced singing and shouting in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
imitation of the canons' voices. Presently they lifted
up the seats of the low stalls, on which the reverend
fathers used to sit when they were not engaged in the
service, and let them fall with a noise. Everybody
knows the fondness little boys have for amusements of
this kind. They gambolled about, but in their games
there was a certain opposition to the worship which their
fathers condemned. The petulance of their age carried
them away. They saw in a corner certain things that
resembled dolls; they could not resist their desire to
take them; and catching hold of the 'priests' mannikins,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_566" id="Ref_566" href="#Foot_566">[566]</a></span>
as Froment calls them, they began to toss to one
another the small grotesque figures with which the
chapels were decorated.</p>

<p class="side">=THE IMAGES BROKEN.=</p>

<p>At this moment Perrin, Goulay, and their friends,
attracted perhaps by the noise, entered the cathedral.
They saw that the great execution had begun; children
were beforehand with them. Passion and impulse carried
them away. They knew that it was the province of
the government only to work out a reform; but when
the government hangs back from its duty, what is to be
done? 'We have petitioned the council to pull down
the idols,' they said; 'and it has not done so for want
of courage. Let us then come to its help and do what
God commands.' At once the daring citizens, going
farther than the children, penetrated into the choir
where the priests were singing, and the latter asked in
alarm what these laymen were going to do. 'On a
sudden,' says the chronicler, 'Perrin and his companions
threw the idols to the ground and broke them.' The
children who saw this began to run about and 'jump
upon those little gods.' Taking up the pieces, they ran
to the door with glee, and called to the people collected
in front of the church: 'Here are the gods of the
priests, will you have a piece?' At the same time they
threw the fragments among the crowd. There was great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
confusion. The wiser heads ineffectually argued that
this work of reform should be left to the council; those
huguenots had no doubts as to their duty. If the magistrates
were unwilling to have the images destroyed,
the Bible commands it. 'The sun is now rising,' they
said, 'and scattering throughout Christendom the dense
clouds that obscure the religion of Jesus Christ.'</p>

<p>The order of things in the middle ages was indeed
incompatible with the new wants of society. Later, in
the time of Calvin, after the first victory had been
gained, it was important to establish Christian doctrine
and to constitute Christian society; but now it was the
time of Farel. It was necessary to appeal to the spirit
of liberty and to the energetic development of the will—this
a conservative writer has acknowledged<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_567" id="Ref_567" href="#Foot_567">[567]</a></span>—a
necessity
in the first ages at the time of the establishment of
Christianity; it was no less a necessity in the sixteenth
century. The powers that had invaded the Church
were so tenacious that the labor necessary to pull them
down was a work of revolution and of war. The moral
fact was the same at the epoch of these two great
dispensations. Whoever applauds the axe which shattered
the colossal statue of Serapis at Alexandria,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_568" id="Ref_568" href="#Foot_568">[568]</a></span>
cannot blame that which threw down the images of a
corrupt worship in the temples of Geneva.</p>

<p>Great was the sorrow felt by the devotees during that
execution; they seemed looking at the fall of the
papacy itself. Some who had remained in the church
contemplated the heart-rending spectacle from afar.
Foolish women of the city, says Froment, began to
weep and to groan. 'Alas! our good saints, our
sacred images (they said) before which we used to
kneel!... Whom shall we adore now?'—and they
'cursed those dogs (<i>cagnes</i>).'</p>

<p>A new and still more striking act increased the wrath
of the priests and that of their partisans. Of all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
Romish dogmas there was none which more disgusted
the huguenots than transubstantiation. To affirm it
(they maintained) was to presume that Jesus Christ,
man and God, was transformed into a little cake. And
hence a French refugee, Maigret, surnamed the Magnificent,
a man without pity for Roman errors, having
found some wafers in the church, threw them upon the
ground; his dog, who followed him, sprang upon them
and ate them up. 'Now if these little cakes had been
real gods,' said the pitiless Maigret, 'they would not
have allowed themselves to be eaten by that beast.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_569" id="Ref_569" href="#Foot_569">[569]</a></span>
No one has combated the doctrine of transubstantiation
more vigorously than Calvin, but he would not have
approved of such a rude mode of acting; later, he expressly
condemned it. 'Let us not take too great
license,' he said.</p>

<p class="side">=HUGUENOT DISCOVERIES.=</p>

<p>The horror of the priests knew no bounds; they ran
out of the church, hastened to the hôtel-de-ville, and
described to the council the violent scenes that had just
taken place. The syndics, irritated because the huguenots
had despised their orders, sent two of their number
to the cathedral—Antoine Chiquand and Ami Bandière.
They were 'much excited,' shouting and threatening
'those who had done this.' But the reformed were not
inclined to give way. They had made strange discoveries.
Some who had begun to search after the famous
arm of St. Anthony—upon which, in important cases,
oaths used to be made with the ringing of bells and
great pomp, found—not the arm of the saint, but the
limb of a stag. Others, opening the precious shrine
which inclosed the head of St. Peter, brought out a
piece of pumice-stone instead of the skull. 'See,' they
exclaimed, showing these objects to the surrounding
crowd, 'see what the priests used to make us worship.'
This gave another direction to the indignation of the
delegates from the council, and one of them, disgusted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
at such mean frauds, said to the other: 'If the gods of
the priests are true gods, let them defend themselves.
As for us we can do no more.' The huguenots, wishing
to make these scandals known to the people, put the
pumice-stone and the stag's bone under magnificent
canopies, and prepared to carry these precious relics of
an apostle and a saint all round the city. The novel
procession attracted an immense crowd, and the disgusting
falsehoods, of which it was a proof, opened the
eyes of the most obstinate. 'Now we know,' they said,
'the value of the priests' words! They made us pay
five florins for the ceremony; they pretended that if
any one made a false oath, the saint would wither up his
hand. All that was only to frighten and plunder us.'
Every one began to despise a clergy who, for so many
ages, had thus played upon the good faith of the people.
An old writer has said: '<i>Justæ quibus est iræ</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_570" id="Ref_570" href="#Foot_570">[570]</a></span>
'Woe
unto the Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_571" id="Ref_571" href="#Foot_571">[571]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening, a certain number of citizens met
together after supper, when the more excited 'proposed
that they should make the round of the other churches
and throw down the idols everywhere.'—'No,' replied
the wiser ones, 'not now; if we did it at so late an
hour, folks would say, as they did of old at Pentecost,
that we are <i>full of new wine</i>. Let us wait until to-morrow
morning.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_572" id="Ref_572" href="#Foot_572">[572]</a></span>
This was the general opinion.</p>

<p>The next day, Monday the 9th of August, early in
the morning, the drum beat in the streets. Some
people asked 'Whether there was any alarm of the
enemy.'—'Make yourselves easy,' they answered; 'it
is only a fight against Rome and her idols.' Everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
was conducted with order: the citizens were
drawn up in their companies. Baudichon de la Maisonneuve,
Pierre Vandel, and Ami Perrin, who were
the three captains of the city, put themselves at their
head, and then they all marched with drums beating
to the church of St. Gervais. It was not a tumultuous
band, but the majority of the people advancing
under the orders of their regular captains. None of
those citizens had the least doubt as to the lawfulness
of his proceedings. The new crusade, like that of
Peter the Hermit, was accomplished to the cry of—<i>It
is the will of God!</i></p>

<p class="side">=SCANDALS AT ST. GERVAIS'.=</p>

<p>There were at St. Gervais' scandals still greater
than at St. Pierre's. The priests, to procure money,
pretended that St. Nazaire, St. Celsus, and St. Pantaleon
were buried under the high altar. When a
poor woman approached, she heard a confused noise.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_573" id="Ref_573" href="#Foot_573">[573]</a></span>
'It is the voices of the holy bodies,' said the priests,
'praying to be taken up and canonized; but that requires
a large sum of money.' Others related how at
the dead of night small luminous creatures were often
seen moving about the cemetery. 'They are souls from
purgatory,' explained the ecclesiastics; 'they wander
about here and there asking for masses for their deliverance.'
Certain persons, wishing to learn the
truth, crept one night into the cemetery, caught some
of those poor souls, and found that they were—crabs,
with small wax tapers lighted and fastened on their
backs.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_574" id="Ref_574" href="#Foot_574">[574]</a></span>
Frivolous men laughed, but serious men, seeing
to what guilty manœuvres the priests had been driven
by the love of gain, were seized with horror. 'Avarice
so excites them,' said Calvin one day, 'that there is
nothing they will not try, how bad soever it may be—treacheries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
frauds innumerable, hatreds, poisonings—as
soon as the gleam of silver or gold has dazzled
their eyes.'</p>

<p>The three captains and their companies, having
reached the church, began by exploring the vault where
the three saints groaned, and discovered the trick.
They found under the altar two earthen vessels connected
by a tube, and pierced with holes like those in an
organ-pipe, so that the least noise over the vessels produced
the effect of organ-bellows, and caused a sound
like the indistinct murmur of persons talking.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_575" id="Ref_575" href="#Foot_575">[575]</a></span>
'The
poor papists could not believe it.'—'No!' they said; 'it
is St. Nazaire, St. Celsus, and St. Pantaleon.'—'Come
and see then,' answered the reformers. They came and
saw, and 'some of them from that hour refused to believe
any more in such abuses.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_576" id="Ref_576" href="#Foot_576">[576]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=MIRACLES AT ST. DOMINIC'S.=</p>

<p>The judgment having been accomplished at St. Gervais,
the three captains turned their steps towards the church
of St. Dominic, one of the chief sanctuaries of popery
between the Jura and the Alps. Great miracles were
worked there: the huguenots called them 'great swindles.'
A beautiful image adorned in a costly manner, and
representing Our Lady, stood in the church, and had
the power (it was said) of calling back to life the children
who had died without baptism. Poor people
came to Geneva from all the country round, with their
lifeless little children, and laid them on the altar before
the image. Then a feather placed on the infant's
mouth flew into the air, or else the cheeks flushed with
red: sometimes the child perspired. The spectators
cried out: 'A miracle!' 'The child is resuscitated'
(<i>revicoullé</i>), said the monks. Immediately the bells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
rang, the child was christened, and then buried. 'The
child had never been restored alive to its father or
mother,' said the huguenots, 'and yet they had to pay
dearly for it.' The citizens lifted up the altar and
found two machines under it: on one side were certain
instruments in which they blew to make the child
breathe, and on the other some stones which were heated
to make the child turn color or perspire. An ointment
with which they had smeared it became soft, and
gave a certain hue to its flesh. 'Really,' exclaimed the
Genevans, 'those who believe such clumsy absurdities
ought to have been converted—into blocks!' Henceforth
Our Lady ceased to work miracles.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_577" id="Ref_577" href="#Foot_577">[577]</a></span></p>

<p>The band of reformers, having passed to the refectory,
found there a carving representing a big fat woman at a
table cutting up a large pie, with monks seated round
her. Beneath were these words from psalm cxxxiii.,
<i>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to
dwell together in unity!</i> At this moment Farel came
up: 'Is it thus, my fathers,' he said, 'that you interpret
Holy Scripture? Have you not jeered enough at men,
but you must jeer also at the Word of God? By what
right do you adapt it to your gluttony?' 'Alas!' exclaimed
the monks, 'excuse us; you have come too late
to make us renounce our good customs.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_578" id="Ref_578" href="#Foot_578">[578]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile some huguenots had stopped before another
piece of sculpture, at which they were quite amazed.
At the top they saw a devil with seven heads: from
the devil issued the pope with his triple crown; from
the pope issued the cardinals; from the cardinals the
bishops, monks, and priests ... and below them was
a burning furnace representing hell. The reformed
Genevans were astonished to find in a convent of St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
Dominic a satire upon the papacy, more cutting than all
that they had ever imagined.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_579" id="Ref_579" href="#Foot_579">[579]</a></span></p>

<p>The three captains and their companies arrived at
last near the Arve, where stood the church of Notre
Dame; but the syndic, informed of what was going
on, arrived at the same time, and wishing to save a
famous picture of the Virgin, had it carried before
them to the hôtel-de-ville. There was no lack of
raillery; people asked if they were going to work miracles
with the picture? and they were compelled to
burn it in the great hall to escape the jokes that were
showered upon them.</p>

<p>The campaign was over; the citizens returned to
their homes; the Christian conscience approved of
their work. The suppression of so many shameful
frauds—was it not ordered in heaven? From that
day mass was sung no longer in any of the churches.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_580" id="Ref_580" href="#Foot_580">[580]</a></span>
The action of the citizens was more than a popular
movement: the Reform was strengthened by it. No
one would have condemned the vile tricks of the
priests more than the honest and brave Luther. Yet
Luther, putting specially in the foreground the great
doctrine of man's justification by faith, thundered
against indulgences and other pretended good works,
but tolerated images; while Zwingle, Farel, and Calvin,
regarding especially God, His glory, and His grace,
protested against every apotheosis of the creature,
against all paganism, and particularly against all images
in the Lord's temple. Here then was a characteristic
difference between Lutheranism and the Reform.</p>

<p>Great was the sorrow and anger of the priests.
Gathered round the ruins of what they had adored,
some remained silent while others uttered cries of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
horror. The threats of the clergy were such that the
alarmed council that very day called the three captains
before them, and asked if they intended to obey orders.
'Certainly,' they replied; 'we destroyed the images,
because they were set up contrary to God's Word.'
The syndics, struck with the firmness of those men,
summoned the council of Two Hundred for the next
day.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_581" id="Ref_581" href="#Foot_581">[581]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day was the 10th of August, a memorable
day which was to decide the destiny of Geneva. There
was great agitation throughout the city. Some of the
friends of Rome still hoped, trusting in the antiquity
of their forms and traditions; but the reformed believed
the cause of the Reformation gained, since there was
on its side God, His Word, and the majority of the
citizens and of the councils. The two hundred senators
having taken their place, and many other persons of
note sitting near them, Farel appeared, accompanied
by Pierre Viret, Jacques Bernard, and several laymen.
His slight appearance, his complexion tanned by the
sun, and his red beard, so dreaded by the priests, had
nothing imposing; but there was in that man a heart
burning with love for Christ's Gospel, and from those
thick lips flowed streams of masculine eloquence which
carried away all hearers. He advanced firm and sure
of the victory of the Reformation. It is written: <i>Whatsoever
is born of God overcometh the world. Fear not.</i>
There was much talking and agitation in the assembly:
the men who composed it had a presentiment of great
things; they felt the importance of the crisis, and, full
of anxiety about what would happen, fixed their eyes
on Farel.</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL BEFORE THE COUNCIL.=</p>

<p>Silence having been proclaimed, the reformer, holding
the minutes of the disputation in his hand, began to
speak, and selected as the principal points of the debate
the worship of images and the sacrifice of the mass.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
He reminded them 'that most of those who demanded
their maintenance had abstained from appearing; that
others had not been able to defend them, and that many
had rejected them. 'Why,' he exclaimed, 'should not
all embrace the Gospel? We are ready, my colleagues
and I, not only to make a public confession, but (if
necessary) to sprinkle it with our blood.' Then addressing
the council directly, and raising his 'voice of
thunder,' says a Roman-catholic author, he called upon
the assembly to deliver a judgment that should give
glory to God. 'What!' said he: 'the dominion of the
papacy is falling, and would you lift your hands to
support what God is overthrowing? Will you always
halt between two opinions? If the pope really utters
oracles, listen to him; but if the voice we hear in
Scripture is God's voice, do what it ordains.'—Here
Farel stopped: he felt the importance of the decision
that was about to be taken, and a profound emotion
came over him. Lifting his hands towards heaven, he
exclaimed: 'O God! enlighten this council, make it
understand that Thy glory and the salvation of all this
people are concerned; humble the loud boasting of the
priests,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_582" id="Ref_582" href="#Foot_582">[582]</a></span>
and make Thy cause triumph.' This 'earnest
prayer,' as a manuscript terms it, made a deep impression
upon all who heard it.</p>

<p>The deliberation began: it was calm, serious, thoughtful,
and marked with all the dignity such an important
affair demanded. The most earnest reformers would
have liked the immediate cessation of popery in Geneva;
but the council thought it wiser to proceed slowly. As
Farel had uttered a new challenge against the priests,
the premier syndic proposed to call upon them to defend
the mass and image-worship if they could. Meanwhile
it was ordered, that (not to offend the catholics)
the pulling down of images should be stopped, and that
(not to offend the reformers) the celebration of mass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
should cease. These resolutions passed almost unanimously.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_583" id="Ref_583" href="#Foot_583">[583]</a></span></p>

<p>But Rome was already vanquished and the friends of
the reformed were eager to prove it. A layman stood
up and said: 'You call up the priests, but I am much
afraid there is not one left in the city. They are all
thinking of running away and carrying off the church
treasures. Why should we always temporize? The reform
of the abuses which disfigured religion, far from
damaging its existence, will restore it to itself, just as
washing a smeared and dirty picture restores it to its
primitive condition. That bishop, those priests, those
citizens who run away, are not the Church, they are only
deserters.' The council resolved unanimously that the
Romish priests who fled were not carrying the Church
of Geneva with them, and ordered an inventory to be
taken of all ecclesiastical property. The sitting then
broke up.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_584" id="Ref_584" href="#Foot_584">[584]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CONFISCATION OF CHURCH PROPERTY.=</p>

<p>The mass was suppressed: this was an enormous step.
The abolition of the mass was the abolition of popery.
The reform was immediately carried into execution.
The next day (11th August) a formal order was issued
'neither to sing nor to say mass' in the city of Geneva.
The frightened priests obeyed: they drew in their horns,
they hid themselves, and took good care not to permit
the least chant to be heard. Ere long there was a new
trouble. They saw the commissioners of the council
enter the churches and draw up an inventory of the
furniture, jewels, and ecclesiastical property. With
downcast eyes and silent lips, the ministers of Rome
beheld the disappearance of the fine portraits, pyxes,
chalices, and other precious works, which were removed
to a place of safety beyond the reach of dilapidation.
They were valued at more than ten thousand crowns.
From that day no Roman service was celebrated in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
city. There was not to be found among the clergy one
of those enthusiastic souls who rush into the midst of
danger to uphold and to proclaim their faith.</p>

<p>These bold acts were not, however, accomplished without
a murmur. The populace generally was for the
Roman worship, and some opposition cries were heard.
'If the mass is no longer sung,' said some timid souls
to the syndics, 'the people may rise.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_585" id="Ref_585" href="#Foot_585">[585]</a></span>
'Ah!' said some
prudent men, 'if the mass is sung again, that would
create a still greater disturbance.' The council therefore
maintained the prohibition. A few catholics,
faithful to the superstitions of ages, might be seen going
at the canonical hours into the silent churches, wandering
like ghosts through the deserted aisles, and
shedding tears. Alas! there were no more chants, no
more prayers, no more masses, no more litanies, no more
incense! The priests and the organ—all were silent.</p>

<p>In those days of great alarm a few women only displayed
any courage. 'We will not strike our colors,'
said the sisters of St. Claire. And in fact they did hear
the mass, but with closed doors and in low tones in the
middle of the choir, and sometimes, for greater security,
in the refectory. Zealous catholics went and knocked
stealthily at the convent gate and begged in a whisper
to be admitted to the masses celebrated without singing
and without pomp. They joined in the service with
trembling: they pricked up their ears and were alarmed
at the least noise. This fidelity did not last long. Five
days later, on the 5th of August, the feast of the Assumption,
the last communion took place. The father-confessor
and his companions, after saying mass timidly,
stole out of the city.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_586" id="Ref_586" href="#Foot_586">[586]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CHRIST, AND NOT CEREMONIES.=</p>

<p>While night was gradually stretching its veil over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
popery and its followers, the sun rose higher upon the
friends of the Holy Scriptures. There were no more
Latin chants, no more theatrical postures, sacerdotal
garments, pictures and incense; none of those practices
pleasing to the eye, to the ear, or to the smell, which
had so long reigned in the Church; but in their place
Jesus Christ;—Christ, in the past, making atonement
on the cross for the sins of His people;—Christ, in the
present, always in the midst of His followers, vivifying,
sanctifying, and consoling their hearts. These Christian
men had entered into the new era of truth and charity,
to which the reformers invited them. While the councils
were busy particularly with the maintenance of
tranquillity; while the great body sought only independence
and liberty—precious goods, but which cannot
suffice—the small body of truly pious souls, acknowledging
the Son of God as the author of a new life, were
decided to follow wherever He should lead them.</p>

<p>The fall of the mass, which dates from the 10th of
August, was regarded by the reformed as a sign of
victory, and the Genevan Church, adopting this idea,
celebrates every century in the month of August (reckoning
from 1535) the jubilee of its reformation. After
three years of struggles the first victory was gained;
but a fourth year was to pass away before the definitive
establishment of the Reform. Let us therefore continue
our march until May 1536, and even until the arrival of
Calvin.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">PRIESTS, MONKS, NUNS, AND VICAR-GENERAL DEPART.<br />
 (<span class="smc">August to December 1535.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> Reformation protested against the hierarchy. It
denied that Christ had given to the Church or to its
heads the power of making laws by the fulfilment of
which Christians would be justified before God. The
Reformation protested against monkery. It denied
that a cloistered life could merit salvation and give a
piety superior to what the Word of God requires of
all Christians; it reproached the monastic discipline
with lowering the divine institutions of marriage,
government, and labor; and was an occasion of backsliding
and unheard-of scandal.</p>

<p class="side">=THE MONKS ARE DUMB.=</p>

<p>The priests were about to quit Geneva and carry
away with them those abuses; but the council, which
always studied to proceed by equitable ways, would not
condemn them without hearing them. The monks of
the different convents, demoralized and trembling like
culprits, had, it is true, fled in great numbers. Still
there were some remaining, and they received an order
to appear before the Great Council to defend their faith.
They were very alarmed, but the order was peremptory.
On the morning of the 12th of August those members
of the order of St. Dominic, St. Augustin, St. Francis,
and the minors of Ste. Claire who were still in Geneva
arrived at the hôtel-de-ville. They were twelve in
number, a poor remnant of those powerful bodies who
for long had possessed such great power in the city.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
The twelve, standing with bent heads before the
council, heard a summary of the disputation read, and
this added to their alarm. The premier syndic having
asked them if they had anything to say in favor of the
mass and of images, all remained silent. St. Dominic,
St. Francis, and even St. Augustin were dumb before
the Reform. The syndics, desiring at any price to
extract a sound from them, ordered the monks to be
called up one after the other. Chapelain, a brother of
St. Dominic, was called first. 'We are simple people,'
he said, 'who cannot answer for want of knowledge.
We are accustomed to live as our fathers lived and to
believe as the Church does. Do not ask us about
matters beyond our reach.' The other monks were
unanimous in requesting that they might be permitted
not to inquire into such questions. Monkery fell in
Geneva amid universal astonishment and indignation.</p>

<p>But after the monks came the priests. Monseigneur
de Bonmont, vicar-episcopal, had, at the request of the
council, assembled the canons and the secular clergy at
his house. The same day (12th August) in the afternoon,
a distinguished deputation of syndics and councillors,
wishing to honor the church, went to the grand-vicar,
instead of making him come to the hôtel-de-ville
like the monks. The wise and pious Savoye, who
had been elected spokesman, informed the priests that
a summary of the great disputation having been drawn
up, it was about to be read to them, 'that they might
come to a better decision.' The latter displayed less
weakness than the monks. Indignant that laymen
should presume to catechise the priesthood, they replied
haughtily: 'We do not want to hear your debate, and
we do not care what Farel said. We wish to live as we
have hitherto done, and beg you will leave us in peace.'
As the priests rejected the opportunity given them of
justifying their doctrines, the representatives of the
state interdicted them from celebrating mass until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
further orders. Some days later the council ordered
them 'to worship God according to the Gospel,' and
forbade them to perform 'any act of popish idolatry.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_587" id="Ref_587" href="#Foot_587">[587]</a></span></p>

<p>A great and salutary revolution was thus carried out.
The Romish priests, seeing their vast temples now silent,
their rich abbeys now bare, and themselves reduced to
silence, determined to quit Geneva. The fear of being
detained made them have recourse to various expedients.
In the evening or early in the morning they
stole out of the city, or else, hiding in some corner
during the day, they fled during the night. Priests,
laymen, women holding their children's hands, bade
adieu to the cheerful city, to the shores of the beautiful
lake, and to its smiling hills. They loved Rome and
Rome was sufficient for them. On the 13th of August
a cry of alarm was heard in the council: 'Geneva,' it
was said, 'by losing a part of its population, will lose its
importance.' But it was the contrary that happened.
Confessors of the Gospel compelled to quit their country
in the cause of faith, and especially Frenchmen, were
to fill up the void made by the adherents of the pope.</p>

<p>The exodus continued day and night, but not without
difficulty. Jean Regis, a priest, and two of his colleagues
crept one dark night to the back of St. Victor's
convent, entered the stables, and took out three horses.
They were preparing to mount them when they were
arrested. The council assembled at two hours after
midnight, and sent to prison the priests who were
running away on stolen horses.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_588" id="Ref_588" href="#Foot_588">[588]</a></span>
The council prevented
the clergy from laying hands upon what did not belong
to them, but not from going wherever they pleased.</p>

<p>A great number of ecclesiastics and laymen succeeded,
however, in gaining the states of the Duke of Savoy, and
wherever they went they stirred up the anger of the
catholics against Geneva. The storm that was brewing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
became more threatening. It was not enough for the
Genevans to see their fields laid waste, they learnt from
Savoy that the city itself was going to be destroyed.
The citizens thrilled with anger: 'As the attack is to
take place in favor of popery,' they said, 'it is right that
popery should pay for the defence.' The council, therefore,
decided that the church jewels should be devoted
to the necessities of the state. The priests of St.
Germain, St. Gervais, and other parishes brought their
reliquaries and vessels; but the proctors of the Madeleine
appeared empty-handed at the hôtel-de-ville, and
said: 'By what right do you demand our treasures?'
At the same time the ex-syndic, Jean Balard, and other
catholics, seizing the opportunity, exclaimed: 'Why do
you deprive us of our masses?' But the council was
firm, and the priests of the Madeleine, quite broken-hearted,
were obliged to bring their chalices and other
vessels to aid in combating the defenders of their faith.
As the value of these ornaments did not exceed three
hundred crowns, those of St. Pierre were added to
them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_589" id="Ref_589" href="#Foot_589">[589]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=PAUL III. INFORMED.=</p>

<p>It was time for Geneva to be on its guard. At
the beginning of September 1535, the ambassador
from the duke of Savoy, prince of Piedmont, informed
the pope (on behalf of his master) of what had taken
place and asked for prompt repression. He told the
pontiff that 'on the 10th of August the wretched
Lutherans had abolished religion; that they had entered
the churches, had thrown out the relics and the images,
had proclaimed the mass to be an abuse, and had set
the ministers preaching.' Paul III. was thunderstruck;
but true to his silent habits, he only expressed his
surprise by signs. He shrugged his shoulders, said the
ambassador, as if a thrill of horror had run through
him. Then bowing his head he sighed gently, and said
in a low tone: 'Holy Virgin! Holy Virgin!' and sank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
into a deep silence. But if his lips were dumb and his
body motionless, his mind, full of activity, was agitated
and sought some means of conjuring the evil. At last,
breaking silence, he turned to the ambassador: 'Tell
the duke that he has behaved like a good servant of the
Church. He has done all in his power to prevent this
disaster. Let him persevere in the same course.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_590" id="Ref_590" href="#Foot_590">[590]</a></span>
The duke understood him, and, secure of the support of
the pope and of his brother-in-law the emperor, he continued
his preparations against Geneva.</p>

<p class="side">=FAREL PREACHES TO THE NUNS.=</p>

<p>During this time the houses of the priests who remained
in the city, and the aisles of the almost deserted
cloisters, resounded with wailings. This was particularly
the case in the convent of St. Claire.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p>That convent was the only one worthy of any interest:
the reformers wished to attempt to introduce a little
light into it. The Sunday of the Octave after the Visitation
of the Virgin, the syndics, with Farel, Viret, one
of the monks who had embraced the reform, and about
a dozen notables of the city, made their appearance there
about ten o'clock. When the sisters were assembled,
Farel took for his text the gospel of the day: '<i>Maria
abiit cum festinatione in civitatem Judæ</i>:' 'Mary went
with haste into a city of Juda,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_592" id="Ref_592" href="#Foot_592">[592]</a></span>
and tried to enlighten
the nuns. 'You see,' he said, 'the Virgin Mary did not
lead a solitary life; she was diligent in aiding others,
and went to the town where her cousin, who was older
than herself, lived, in order to do her a service. God
said in the days of the Creation: <i>It is not good that the
man should be alone</i>. Why then should man contradict
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
this law of God? The Lord is unwilling that any
restraint should be imposed upon the conscience, since
he has given it liberty. The service rendered to God in
the cloisters is therefore a diabolical tyranny.' At these
words the mother-vicar, a violent woman, rose hastily,
left her seat, went and put herself between the sisters
and the <i>heretics</i>, and said sharply to the latter: 'Be off,
for you will gain nothing here!'—'Return to your place,'
said the syndics; but the mother replied: 'I will do
nothing of the sort.' Consequently they turned her
out.</p>

<p>Farel continued: 'What is this monastic life that is
substituted for holy matrimony and liberty? It is a life
full of great abuses, monstrous errors, and carnal corruption.'
At these words the sisters began to cry out,
'It is a falsehood,' and spat at the reformer in their
wrath.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_593" id="Ref_593" href="#Foot_593">[593]</a></span>
But Farel, who had suffered worse things than
this, said to the confessor: 'We know that many of
these poor young women would willingly come to the
truth and liberty, if you and the old ones did not keep
them so close.' While saying these words he was
stopped by loud blows which prevented his being heard.
It was the mother-vicar, who had been listening to him;
she struck against the partition with her fists, and
cried out: 'Hah! you wretched, cursed man! You are
wasting your coaxing words. Bah! you will make nothing
of them!' She then backed up her words by a
terrible drumming upon the panels.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_594" id="Ref_594" href="#Foot_594">[594]</a></span>
Some of the sisters
stopped their ears with wax, so as not to hear Farel's
sermon. The latter, calling to mind the saying, <i>Give
not that which is holy unto the dogs</i>, retired, and the deputation
went down the staircase. The monk who had
embraced the Reform was the last of the file; one of the
sisters walked behind him, thumping him on the shoulders
with her fists, and saying: 'Wretched apostate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
out of my sight!' 'But this fine fellow did not seem to
notice them,' says Jeanne, who was present; 'he said
not a word, his tongue was palsied.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_595" id="Ref_595" href="#Foot_595">[595]</a></span>
The same could
not be said of the mother-vicar, and some others, who
kept on vociferating and thumping. Farel returned no
more to the convent.</p>

<p>One nun, however, had opened her heart to the
Gospel. Claudine Levet, who had a sister named
Blaisine Varembert, in the cloister, had often visited
her, had given her a New Testament, and prayed night
and day to God that Blaisine might be enlightened.
The latter was touched with the love of the Saviour, of
which Claudine had spoken to her; and on the festival
of Corpus Christi she refused to adore the holy sacrament.
Three of the sisters fell upon her, 'and bruised
her all over.' They put her in prison, and tied her
hands and feet. 'Ah!' said Blaisine, 'you keep me
in prison, because I reproach you for making good cheer
and living in strife with one another day and night.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_596" id="Ref_596" href="#Foot_596">[596]</a></span></p>

<p>Claudine Levet and some other Genevan ladies, with
Baudichon de la Maisonneuve and Pierre Vandel, went
to the convent with the intention of liberating the poor
girl. The mother-vicar 'stood upright on her feet,' and
said: 'Gentlemen, consider well what you are about to
do, for if any man comes near, either he or I shall die
upon the spot.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_597" id="Ref_597" href="#Foot_597">[597]</a></span>
Upon this, the men remaining in the
background, two or three ladies approached the
prisoner. The latter, standing by the side of her sister,
declared that she desired to serve God purely, according
to Holy Scripture, and added that she was detained in
the convent against her will. 'In that case you are
free,' said De la Maisonneuve. To no purpose did the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
mother-vicar rush impetuously forward, wishing to
detain her by force, and several nuns did the same;
Blaisine left the convent without saying a word, entered
a neighboring house, took off her religious dress, and
went in plain garments to her sister's.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_598" id="Ref_598" href="#Foot_598">[598]</a></span></p>

<p>Claudine and Blaisine could not, however, make up
their minds to abandon the poor recluses. Possessing
the Word of God, and the salvation that it announces,
they desired to share their good things with them.
The Genevese ladies, attached to the Gospel, had much
faith and activity. The two sisters, therefore, returned
to the convent on Saturday, 28th, and Sunday, 29th
August, and Dame Claude began to speak; but the
nuns tossed their heads, and called out: 'Oh the
great story-teller! Oh the devil incarnate!' And the
mother-vicar, turning towards a syndic who had accompanied
Claudine, along with other 'respectable
persons,' said: 'Take that witch away from here.'
'Beware how you abuse her,' answered the magistrate,
'for she is a holy creature, enlightened by the true
God, and produces great fruits by her divine doctrines,
converting the poor ignorant people, and continually
taking great pains for the salvation of souls.' '<i>Convert</i>,'
exclaimed the superior, 'you should rather say <i>pervert</i>.'
At the same time the sisters spat in her face, according
to the report of one of their number.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_599" id="Ref_599" href="#Foot_599">[599]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DEPARTURE OF THE NUNS.=</p>

<p>When the syndic saw this, he lost all hope. The
duke of Savoy invited the sisters to take refuge in his
states, making them fine promises. 'Fair ladies,' said
the magistrate, 'name the day you wish to depart.'—'To-morrow,'
said the mother-superior, 'to-morrow, at
daybreak.'—'Fair ladies,' resumed the syndic, 'pack up
your goods.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_600" id="Ref_600" href="#Foot_600">[600]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></div>

<p>Early next morning the syndics arrived, when the
sisters, after singing a <i>De Profundis</i>, put their breviaries
under their arm, and drew up in two ranks.
The mother-vicar placed the young sisters, who might
have any longing to quit the veil, by the side of some
sturdy nuns who could detain them. A great crowd
had assembled before the convent and in the streets.
Seeing this, many of the nuns 'shrank back with fear,'
but the courageous superior said, with animation:
'Cheer up, my sisters, make the sign of the cross, and
keep our Lord in your hearts.' They stepped forward.
This procession of veiled and silent women represented
Roman-catholicism leaving Geneva. Sobs were heard
here and there. Three hundred archers marched in
front, behind, and at the side of the nuns, to protect
them. 'If any one moves,' said the syndic to the
spectators, 'he shall lose his head.' The crowd looked
on silently as the sisters passed along.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_601" id="Ref_601" href="#Foot_601">[601]</a></span></p>

<p>When the procession arrived at the Arve bridge,
where the territory of the city ceased, the nuns, who
had imagined they would find the duke and his court
waiting at the frontiers of his states to receive them
with great honor, could see nobody. A poor monk
alone appeared, bringing a wretched wagon, in order
to carry the old and sick.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_602" id="Ref_602" href="#Foot_602">[602]</a></span></p>

<p>The rain and the muddy roads delayed their progress.
The poor nuns, who knew nothing but their
convent, were startled at everything. Seeing a few
sheep grazing in a meadow, they screamed aloud,
taking them (says one of the sisters) for <i>ravening
wolves</i>. A little farther on, some cows which were in
the fields, attracted by this troop passing along,
stretched out their heads towards the road, and lowed.
The nuns imagined they were <i>hungry bears</i>, and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
not even strength to run away. At nightfall they
reached St. Julien, having taken fifteen hours to go a
short league. The next day they entered Annecy,
where the duke gave them the monastery of the Holy
Cross. All the bells of the city rang at their arrival.
Here the poor nuns found some repose; but they did
not forget the judgment of God that had banished
them from Geneva, and did not hide the cause of their
misfortunes. 'Ah!' said Sister Jeanne de Jussie, 'the
prelates and churchmen did not observe their vows at
this time, but squandered dissolutely the ecclesiastical
property, keeping women in adultery and lubricity, and
<i>awakening the anger of God</i>, which brought divine punishment
on them.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_603" id="Ref_603" href="#Foot_603">[603]</a></span></p>

<p>If the truth extorted such a confession from a nun,
an honest but fanatical disciple of popery, we may
understand what the reformed thought and said. A
cry came from their hearts against the immorality and
hypocrisy of those who ought to have been their
guides. Hence there was great agitation among the
priests; they came running in a distracted manner to
Monseigneur de Bonmont, and asking him: 'What is
to be done? must we stay or go?'</p>

<p class="side">=FLIGHT OF THE GRAND-VICAR.=</p>

<p>The grand-vicar thought it was necessary to go. Public
opinion declared unequivocally against him: he was
one of those priests who called forth Sister Jeanne's
reproof. 'Monseigneur keeps in his house several mistresses
and agents of debauchery,' people said. 'Gaming,
<i>mots de gueule</i>, dances, banquets, impudicity, and
every kind of dissolute living, are his delight. He
generally has five vile prostitutes at his table, seated
according to their degree, two at his right and two at
his left, while the oldest waits upon the others. He
smiles when he talks of impudicity, and says, "It is a
mere backsliding, and does not count."' Seeing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
storm grow darker, the wretched priest was terrified in
his conscience, and resolved to act like his bishop, and
quit a city where he could no longer live as he had
always lived. The Reformation was the re-establishment
of morality as well as of faith. Monseigneur fled to the
mountain, to solitude in the abbey of Bonmont, near
Nyon, on a spur of the Jura, which overlooks Lake
Leman and its rich valley. Another terror was soon to
drive him thence.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_604" id="Ref_604" href="#Foot_604">[604]</a></span></p>

<p>The anger of God (spoken of by Jeanne) continued to
work out his judgments: opprobrium accumulated on
those priests who had thought themselves the kings of
the earth. On the 18th of September, some of the
citizens having caught one of them in an act of impurity,
they set him on a donkey, and paraded him thus
through the city, making his mistress, disguised as a
lackey, walk behind him. Serious men disapproved
of such buffoonery. 'Ah!' they said, 'disease, the consequence
of their disorders, has so punished them, that
as we see them pass along in their processions we might
imagine them to be soldiers returning from the war, they
are so covered with scars—true martyrs of the pope!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_605" id="Ref_605" href="#Foot_605">[605]</a></span>
The magistrates would have liked not to punish them,
not to banish them, but to reform them. 'Give up,'
they said, 'your dances, gluttony, and dissolute living,
and dwell in our city according to God's law, like citizens
and good friends.' But that seemed too difficult for the
priests: they preferred to leave Geneva.</p>

<p>The most active, however, remained. Dupan and
some of his colleagues went from house to house,
strengthening the weak. They might be seen passing
along the streets, wearing their sacerdotal vestments.
If a child was born, they hastened to christen it according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
to the Roman ritual; if fervent Catholics desired the
sacrament, they met secretly in some chamber, knelt
down before a hastily constructed altar, crossed themselves,
and said mass. They even carried their zeal so
far as to visit certain of the reformed, in order to bring
them back to the fold of the Church. At the very
moment when the edifice was giving way on all sides,
their natural inflexibility and enthusiasm for the papacy
made them remain, as if their feeble hands were sufficient
to support it. Such courage claims our admiration,
but the reformed considered it rather as a matter
for serious anxiety. They felt the necessity of concord
and unity at this critical moment. 'See what your
condescension exposes us to,' they said to the magistrates.
'Just as the enemy is marching against the
city, these priests are going to stir up a civil war within
our gates.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_606" id="Ref_606" href="#Foot_606">[606]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=HOSPITAL AND SCHOOL FOUNDED.=</p>

<p>The syndics who knew the danger and the necessities
of the city, thought that the best means of securing to
Geneva her independence and her faith, would be to set
everything in good order. The Reformation is a good
tree; let it therefore bear its fruit! Christians ought
to take care of their sick and of their poor. Accordingly,
a general hospital was founded at Ste. Claire, and
endowed with the revenues of the old hospitals and the
property become ownerless through the departure of the
ecclesiastics. Claude Salomon, one of the most fervent
evangelicals, dedicated himself, his wife, and his fortune
to its service.</p>

<p>Christians ought to take care of their children. It is
true that in 1429, F. de Versonex, the syndic, had
founded a school where grammar, logic, and the liberal
arts were taught; but the director of that institution
having left the city, the school had been shut. It must
be restored and improved. Farel and his friends required
that the instruction should be universal—for all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
children. The school was established in the place
which is still named Rue du Vieux Collège, and its
direction intrusted to Saunier, a capable man.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_607" id="Ref_607" href="#Foot_607">[607]</a></span></p>

<p>After the extirpation of ignorance came the suppression
of mendicity. An order was published by sound of
trumpet on the 29th of October, 'that no person should
beg, but seek shelter in the poor-house.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_608" id="Ref_608" href="#Foot_608">[608]</a></span></p>

<p>Subsequently these institutions received important
developments. It was not until the period when the
college and academy were founded by Calvin that instruction
took a start in Geneva, which carried intellectual
culture to such a height in that city. But the
starting-point was Saunier's college, where primary instruction
was mixed up with religion. The Reformation
launched Geneva like a ship, which at first coasts along
the nearest shores, but reaches at last the remotest seas.
It was not simply a matter of theological dogma, as
some believe; it developed the conscience, the understanding,
and the heart, and regulated the will. It did
not form merely a few Christian men; it gave to that
city a new people, school, church, literature, science,
and charity; it gave new value to the great interests of
man, and called into existence a well-spring of useful
research and elevated thoughts. The Reformation was
able to say:</p>

<p class="center small">Humani nihil a me alienum puto.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_609" id="Ref_609" href="#Foot_609">[609]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ROMANISM ENDS IN GENEVA.=</p>

<p>While the council was carrying out these beneficent
measures, a certain number of agitated and restless
priests kept going from house to house, consulting
together and professing opinions that tended to rebellion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
Instead of taking harsh measures against them,
the magistrates loyally determined to give them a fresh
opportunity of defending their faith. On the 29th of
November thirty priests, headed by Dupan, appeared
before the council. There were still thirty priests in
Geneva and only three ministers! It was not, therefore,
by numbers and by the might of man, that the
Reformation was established, but by the power of God.
The premier syndic asked them to undertake the defence
of popery. 'We have neither the ability nor the
learning,' answered Dupan; and he added: 'Sooner
than expose our religion to a new discussion, we will
give up all pastoral functions.' The priesthood abdicated.
On the 6th of December the council again
called the priests before them, and gave them this
option: 'If your doctrine is good, defend it; if bad,
renounce it.' Then the break-up began. 'For a long
time,' said Delorme, 'I have been saying mass unwillingly,'
and he passed over, with others, to the side of
the Reform. Some left the city; and the council
required that those who remained 'should wear other
hats,' and live like the rest of the citizens. Lastly,
wishing to make it evident that there was no longer in
Geneva either bishop or prince, the council voted that
the episcopal palace should be converted into a prison.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_610" id="Ref_610" href="#Foot_610">[610]</a></span>
This was no change in its destination, according to
certain sarcastic huguenots, since the bishop and his see
had never been of any use but to keep liberty captive.
Thus ended the existence of the Romish priesthood in
Geneva. The magistrates, far from persecuting catholicism,
had on several occasions put the priests in a
position to defend it: it was the religion of the popes
that fled and made way for the religion of the Holy

modern times, did not certainly preside at that day in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
the councils of the republic; but as an historian of
Geneva, who is not a protestant, has said, 'We must
not demand of an age ideas, theories, and acts which
could not exist until after events and revolutions still to
come.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_611" id="Ref_611" href="#Foot_611">[611]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing that the priests were departing, that their
chants no longer re-echoed through the lofty Gothic
aisles, that the tapers no longer burnt upon the gorgeous
altars and the varied ceremonial had disappeared,
Farel, Viret, and Froment came forward and said: 'We
are ready to preach without sparing ourselves either
weariness or labor, and to employ all the power of the
Word to lead the flock into the straight road with wisdom
and gentleness.' And in fact from that hour the
Word which awakeneth and teacheth was heard daily in
the churches, and particularly at St. Pierre and St.
Gervais. The hearers said that these true ministers of
the Gospel 'did not behave like old-clothes men (<i>revendeurs</i>),
who are accustomed to polish up their wares
and put a gloss upon their old rags, in order to get more
money for them; but they offered the pure and simple
doctrine of Jesus Christ.' Many felt that the Word of
God was a sword which pierces to the heart and kills
the old man in such a manner that a new man takes the
place of him that was slain.</p>

<p>Farel assembled the people in the cathedral in order
that they should all pray for peace to God who giveth
it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_612" id="Ref_612" href="#Foot_612">[612]</a></span>
These prayers ascended to heaven. Geneva was
to have peace, but after new trials.</p>

 <span style="font-size:80%">AN ENERGETIC CITIZEN CALLS SWITZERLAND TO HELP
 GENEVA AND THE REFORMATION.<br />
 (<span class="smc">September and October 1535.</span>)</span></h3>

<p class="side">=THE COMING TEMPEST.=</p>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> joy which then filled Geneva was not to be of
long duration. The sky was fair, and yet certain signs
indicated that the tempest was not far off. The Reformation
which had been accomplished excited the most
serious uneasiness at Turin, at Rome, and around the
puissant Charles V. Hitherto a few desultory attacks
had been made against the city: its territory had been
laid waste, its provisions intercepted, and ladders had
been placed against its walls: but now a regular campaign
was about to be opened, and the enemy were
decided not to lay down their arms until they had taken
it and transformed it into a popish and Savoyard city.
The partisans of Rome felt their danger; they saw that
as Geneva was at the gates of France, Italy, and Germany,
if the Reformation was settled there, it might
compromise the existence of the papacy itself.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_613" id="Ref_613" href="#Foot_613">[613]</a></span>
Accordingly
all their thoughts were bent on putting down
<i>the revolt</i>, though at the cost of much bloodshed, and
of treating Geneva as Alby, 'of holy and illustrious
memory,' had been treated formerly. Paul III., a
friend of the world and of the fine arts, wished, however,
to employ milder means at first—to reduce the city
by famine. 'These Lutherans of four days' standing,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
he said, 'will soon be disgusted with their heresy.' He
was deceived, but the duke of Savoy did not share his
mistake. That prince, who showed a certain kindness
towards his party, was hard, violent, and merciless
whenever Geneva was concerned. He was to be the
Simon de Montfort of the new crusade. 'It is impossible,'
people said, 'that the Genevans can hold out
in the face of the duke's alliances. On the one hand,
there is his brother-in-law the emperor, his nephew
the king of France, his father-in-law the king of Portugal,
and his allies the Swiss; and then all his own
subjects, who hem in Geneva for two hundred leagues
round, as wolves surround a fold of helpless sheep.
On the other hand, there is the pope, the cardinals, the
bishops, and the priests, whose favor and support the
bishop of Geneva possesses.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_614" id="Ref_614" href="#Foot_614">[614]</a></span>
The cabinet of Turin
resolved, therefore, to set to work. On the 30th of
August the duke publicly proclaimed Geneva as infected
with the plague, forbade his subjects, under
pain of death, to have any communication with its
inhabitants, and promised hospitality in his states to
all who desired to escape from the pestilence. It was
thought in Piedmont that only a few mischief-makers
would remain, and that one bold stroke would make
the ducal army master of the city. Everything was
prepared in the states of Charles IV. to strike a decisive
blow.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_615" id="Ref_615" href="#Foot_615">[615]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE EMPEROR'S PROJECTS.=</p>

<p>On the 28th of August and 24th of September,
numerous companies came as far as the gates of Geneva,
but the citizens drove them back. These were
mere skirmishes of outposts: more formidable attacks
were in preparation. Charles V., victorious over
Barbarossa, called upon the Swiss League, assembled
at Baden near Zurich, to give material help to the
duke of Savoy. It was said in many quarters that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
the plan of that ambitious monarch was to destroy
four cities—Algiers, Geneva, Wittemberg, and Constantinople—two
cities of the Koran and two of the
Gospel. Did not an old prophecy speak of an emperor
who was to achieve the conquest of the world,
command 'the adoration of the cross under pain of
death, and then be crowned at Jerusalem by <i>an angel
of God</i>?'—'That emperor,' said many, 'is Charles V.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_616" id="Ref_616" href="#Foot_616">[616]</a></span></p>

<p>Alarm was beginning to creep over the Genevese
people; the councils deliberated, but in vain, as to what
could be done to save the city. Fathers and mothers
sat by their firesides with downcast eyes, silent lips, and
foreheads burdened with care; and groups collected
here and there in the streets, talking earnestly about
their misfortunes! 'All round the city there is nothing
but fighting, blockade of provisions, plunder, and
conflagration. Within the city correspondence on a
large scale with the enemy. How can a handful of men
resist such a multitude?' Then the preachers of the
Word pointed to the glorious deliverances recorded in
the Scriptures. 'God will do the same for you to-day,'
they said, 'provided you place your whole trust in Him.'
And lifted up by that mighty word, those men against
whom princes took counsel together, exclaimed: 'We
will place our hope and our refuge in God alone.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_617" id="Ref_617" href="#Foot_617">[617]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles III., encouraged by the emperor's support,
sent his ambassadors to the Swiss Cantons, and demanded
that the duke and the bishop, 'escorted by my
Lords of Berne, should be brought back to Geneva, to
resume all their pre-eminence therein; and that no
person should make innovations.' Happily the deputies
from Geneva—Lullin, Des Clefs, and Claude Savoye were
there, and remained firm as rocks to uphold the rights
of their country. The Swiss, finding the two parties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
equally inflexible, withdrew, saying: 'This affair of
Geneva tires us to death; get out of it the best way you
can!' Lullin and Des Clefs returned to Geneva; but
Claude Savoye, determined to obtain help, remained in
the territories of the League.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_618" id="Ref_618" href="#Foot_618">[618]</a></span></p>

<p>The hopes of this energetic reformer were not without
some foundation. When the council of Berne had
heard of the abolition of the mass at Geneva, they had
rejoiced, and, on the 28th of August, had written a letter
of congratulation to the magistrates: 'Seeing that
you have learnt the truth,' they said, 'be watchful over
it and persevere firmly. So doing, be not afraid that
God will let you be destroyed at last.' Claude Savoye
departed for Berne, and on arriving there went from
house to house and appeared before the heads of the
State, 'What!' said he, 'you sent us your minister
Farel, and now that we have obeyed the Word which
he preached to us, you deliver us up into the cruel hands
of our enemies.' That noble reformer, Berthold Haller,
supported him with all his strength, and called upon
Berne 'not to abandon Geneva faint-heartedly.' Meanwhile
the deputies from Turin canvassed the lords of the
council on the opposite side. Self-interest prevailed
among the patricians. 'Raise troops for your own defence,'
they told Claude Savoye, 'provided it be not on
our territory; all that we can possibly do for you is to
commend you to God's grace.' And they ended with
this expressive but familiar saying: 'The shirt is nearer
to us than the coat.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_619" id="Ref_619" href="#Foot_619">[619]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=GENEVA TRUSTS IN GOD.=</p>

<p>When the Genevans heard of Berne's refusal, they
were thunderstruck. Berne, reformed like themselves,
abandoned them! The faith, so necessary to nations,
began to waver in many hearts; but Farel endeavored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
to strengthen those who were shaken. 'Certainly,' he
said to them, 'my lords of Berne have sent us to a
great and strong master—to God. He it is who will
have all the honor of our deliverance, and not men.
He has done mightier things than this. He always
shows his power in what is desperate; and when it
seems that all is lost, it is then that all is won.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_620" id="Ref_620" href="#Foot_620">[620]</a></span></p>

<p>The court of Turin did not think like Farel, and
seeing the Swiss abandoning Geneva, it felt no doubt
that the city, coveted so long, would soon fall into its
hands. It was desirable to take advantage of the
dejection of the citizens; and accordingly the Piedmontese
cabinet hastily sent ambassadors to summon 'my
lords of Geneva,' in the name of their masters, to expel
heresy and the heresiarchs, to restore the bishop and
clergy to their rights, and to set up the images again.
But the Genevese, prouder still in misfortune than in
prosperity, replied to the envoys: 'Noble lords, we will
sacrifice our fortunes, our interests, our children, our
blood, and our lives in defence of the Word of God.
And sooner than betray that holy trust we will set fire
to the four corners of our city, as our Helvetian
ancestors once did.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_621" id="Ref_621" href="#Foot_621">[621]</a></span>
The ambassadors carried back
this heroic answer to their master, and the duke
pressed forward his preparations.</p>

<p>A danger not less great—possibly greater—threatened
Geneva: discord. An implacable hatred 'like
that which in old times existed between Cæsar and
Pompey,' says Froment, divided the captain-general
Philippe and the syndic Michael Sept; a fatal hatred
whence proceeded great woes, with loss of goods, of
honor, and of men, exile, and death. Some took
part with Philippe, others with Michael Sept. 'When
the eldest son of the captain-general,' said the former,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
'was taken prisoner by the men of Peney, who offered
to exchange him against a number of their comrades
who were imprisoned in Geneva, Michael Sept answered:
"No, it would be contrary to the interests of
the state."'—'It is true,' replied the syndic's friends,
'but did he not add: "Let us redeem Philippe's son; I
will give three hundred crowns as my share. If it
were the case of my own child, my advice would not
be different."' The council having refused the exchange
in consequence of this advice, the captain-general,
a liberal and brave but haughty, turbulent,
and violent man, swore a deadly animosity against
Michael Sept. He scattered fire and flame everywhere
against that venerable magistrate, and sacrificing the
interests of his country to his resentment, he retired
murmuring to his tent. 'I am sick,' he replied, 'I will
be captain-general no longer.' Extreme susceptibility
may ruin a man and sometimes a state.</p>

<p>The retirement of the captain-general, in the serious
position in which Geneva was now placed, as well as
the divisions with which it was accompanied, greatly increased
the danger of the city. Moreover, they did not
know whom to appoint as Philippe's successor. Many
named Baudichon de la Maisonneuve; but he was hasty
and impetuous like the other, and the council would
have liked a more sedate, more penetrating, more
prudent character; they feared the eagerness and want
of circumspection of that daring citizen. But his
friends represented that nobody was more devoted to
the cause of independence and of the Gospel; and that
what they wanted now was a chief full of courage and
zeal. De la Maisonneuve was appointed captain-general.</p>

<p>The new commander immediately called a muster of
all the men who were ready to march out with him
against the enemy. They were but four hundred in all.
It mattered not. De la Maisonneuve grasped a banner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
on which he had ordered some fiery tears to be emblazoned.
Greater simplicity might have been more becoming
at such a moment; yet it was a deep and true
feeling of the tragical position in which Geneva was
placed that animated the captain-general. He waved
his standard before his four hundred soldiers, and exclaimed:
'Let every one be prepared to die. It is not
common tears that we must shed, but tears of blood!'</p>

<p class="side">=THE GENEVANS IMPLORE DIVINE AID.=</p>

<p>On returning into the city, the little army went to
the churches. Farel had as much ardor in praying as
Baudichon in fighting. Every day there were sermons
and prayers to the Lord. 'O God,' said the reformer,
'be pleased to defend thy cause!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_622" id="Ref_622" href="#Foot_622">[622]</a></span></p>

<p>In truth, it was not only the independence of Geneva
that was threatened, but the Reformation. The
Genevans enumerated their sufferings, outrages, poverty,
famine, cold, loss of goods, furniture, and cattle, stolen
by bands of plunderers; young children, and even men
and women, carried off, maltreated, and put to death;
attacks made at all hours, and so violently that it was
scarcely possible to hold out longer. But greater misfortunes
were still to come. Charles of Savoy, supported
by the emperor, was recruiting old Italian and Spanish
soldiers, and had selected to command them one of the
cruellest captains of the age, employed somewhat later by
Charles V. against the Protestants of Germany. The
heads of the state, convinced of the danger, made this
declaration on the 3d of October: 'Our enemies are
preparing every day to attack us; so that, if God does
not help us, we cannot escape their blood-stained
hands.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_623" id="Ref_623" href="#Foot_623">[623]</a></span></p>

<p>During this time Claude Savoye, who was soliciting
help from Berne, received nothing but refusals. He was
sad and heart-stricken; all was growing darker round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
him; he knew not whence aid could come. On a sudden
a ray of light cheered him. Farel had proclaimed at
Neuchâtel the Gospel he was preaching at Geneva. The
towns and villages and valleys of that country were the
scene of many of the reformer's victories. He had also
preached to the mountaineers of the see of Basle, who
had imagined they were 'listening to an angel come
down from heaven.' Claude Savoye, rejected by the
lords of Berne, turned his eyes towards the Jura, where
the French language being in use, it would be easy for
him to plead the cause of his country. He shook off
the dust of his feet against Berne, and departed.</p>

<p>There was in those parts a man known for his evangelical
zeal, a friend of Farel, and on whom Savoye
thought he could reckon. Jacob Wildermuth, or Wildermeth,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_624" id="Ref_624" href="#Foot_624">[624]</a></span>
belonged to a family whose members had
filled the highest offices at Bienne, of which they were
the hereditary mayors; but they also possessed the
citizenship of Neuchâtel, and the one of whom we are
speaking seems to have frequently resided in the latter
country. His father had gained distinction in the
famous battles of Morat and Grandson, and he himself
had made the campaigns of Italy from 1512 to 1515.
<i>Wildermuth</i> signifies <i>wild courage</i>, a name very appropriate
to the intrepid warrior. Although advanced in
years,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_625" id="Ref_625" href="#Foot_625">[625]</a></span>
he had all the fire of youth and could support
great fatigue. About the end of 1529, when Farel went
to Neuchâtel, Wildermuth had welcomed him; and
when the magistrates forbade the reformer to preach in
the churches: 'Stay,' said the soldier to him, 'I will
make you preach in the houses.' He was immediately
assailed with threats: 'I can easily brave them,' he said,
'for I know that God is stronger than man or devil.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_626" id="Ref_626" href="#Foot_626">[626]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></div>

<p>Such was the man to whom Claude Savoye made
known the danger of Geneva. He conceived at once the
design of delivering that city. Wildermuth was not
only full of faith in the Gospel, and of aversion to ultramontane
superstitions, but he was intelligent, skilful,
and courageous; and having already made the campaigns
of Italy, he knew better than others how to
organize and lead a body of volunteers. 'A burgess of
Berne,' said the Genevan to him, 'has given me six
hundred crowns, wherewith to raise a troop to fight
against the duke and the pope.'—'Very good,' said the
Swiss warrior, 'I undertake, with the help of my
strong-handed cousin, Ehrard of Nidau,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_627" id="Ref_627" href="#Foot_627">[627]</a></span>
to enrol some
stout fellows, and lead them secretly and promptly to
Geneva.'</p>

<p class="side">=THE HEROINE OF NIDAU.=</p>

<p>Half a league from Bienne, on the lake of that name,
in the Seeland, which forms part of the canton of Berne,
stands the pretty little town of Nidau. Ehrard Bourgeois
was one of the citizens most devoted to the Gospel
and to liberty; and, more than that, he was one of
those strong, practical men, who know how to act upon
others, and who, when they have once embraced a cause,
never give it up until it has triumphed. At once he
made the critical position of Geneva known in Nidau and
its environs. If he had a strong hand, he had a no less
powerful voice; those who loved the Gospel and hated
despotism answered to his call. In a humble dwelling
of this neighborhood there lived a woman with her
husband and three sons, whose name has not been
handed down to us. Filled with ardent zeal for the
Gospel, she determined to contribute to the deliverance
of her brethren of Geneva. A religious spirit has often
invested women with a strength that does not seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
belong to their sex. The heroine of Nidau stood up:
grasping a two-handed sword, and addressing her husband
and three sons, she inspired them all with
courage. She burnt with desire to march with her
people to encounter those soldiers of Savoy, who, urged
on by the pope, were advancing against Geneva. Their
number and force did not stop her. 'Though I should
be alone,' she said to her husband and children, 'I
would fight with this sword against all yonder Savoyards.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_628" id="Ref_628" href="#Foot_628">[628]</a></span>
The father and sons were valiant warriors and
fervent in the Gospel; and all five presented themselves
to Ehrard in order to march to the rescue of Geneva.
It is a great sign when women bestir themselves about
the maintenance of rights, and encourage their sons and
their husbands, instead of dissuading them from the
battle: when this occurs, the enemy is already beaten.
We have seen it in antiquity, and in modern times.
The fire which animated this heroine spread all around
her, and a goodly number of valiant fellows hastened
from the Seeland, Bienne, and the valleys of the Jura,
to be enrolled under the flag of Ehrard.</p>

<p>During this time Claude Savoye and Wildermuth
were appealing to the men of good-will at Neuchâtel
and in its valleys. In every place Savoye uttered his
lament over the poor city of Geneva: 'Help us in
God's name,' he said. 'Give aid and succor to your
Christian brethren, who hold the same faith and obey
the same law as you: and who, because they have the
Gospel preached, and defend their liberties and franchises,
are beleaguered by the enemies of the faith.'
These words were not ineffectual. Many generous
minds threw far from them the selfish thoughts that
might have restrained them. 'Shall we not be moved
with pity towards our brethren in the Lord?' said the
men of Neuchâtel to one another. 'Shall not the
charity we owe to our neighbor impel us?' One of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
the most fervent was Jacques Baillod, called also the
Banneret, whose family, one of the oldest in the Val
de Travers, filled the chief offices of the state. He
was, as it would appear, misshapen in body, short,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_629" id="Ref_629" href="#Foot_629">[629]</a></span>
and a little hunch-backed, not very unlike Æsop (said
some); but he was a skilful and valiant captain. Many
men from the Val de Travers and other places listened
to his appeal. Even at Neuchâtel, an ex-councillor was
distinguished by his zeal; this was André, surnamed
Mazellier, or 'the butcher,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_630" id="Ref_630" href="#Foot_630">[630]</a></span>
one of those firm characters
who, when they have put their hands to the plow,
never look back. 'In a short time,' says a contemporary
chronicler, 'a thousand picked men, fine men-of-war,
faithful and of stout heart—if there are any such in all
Switzerland—were assembled, and ready to march at
once to the succor of Geneva at their own expense.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_631" id="Ref_631" href="#Foot_631">[631]</a></span>
According to others, only eight or nine hundred men
took up arms.</p>

<p class="side">=OPPOSITION OF DE PRANGINS.=</p>

<p>Meanwhile the rumor of these preparations reached
the castle of Neuchâtel. The Sire de Rive de Prangins,
governor of the county for the princess of Longueville,
'a papist and a Savoyard,' says the chronicler Roset;
'a great enemy of the Word,' says Froment; had done
all he could to prevent the establishment of the Reformation
in the county, and now the Neuchâtelans
wanted to go and support Geneva. Astonished at so
much audacity, he forbade those brave men to move
under pain of his serious indignation. Among those
who had answered to the appeal of Savoye, there were
some who now hesitated. A certain number of these
brave men had no strong belief or strong will to
maintain them. Full of respect for the princess and
her lieutenant, they bent easily beneath the authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
which presumed to constrain them. Their wives endeavored
to revive their zeal. In the eyes of the latter
it was not an ordinary war; it was a struggle for the
Word of God. Being ardent evangelists, they had at
heart, as much as Farel, to uphold the faith, and
combined with pure doctrine that keen sensitiveness,
that impulsiveness of the heart, which are the portion of
their sex. 'Go,' they said; 'if you do not go, we will
go ourselves.' Some, indeed, did go, like the heroine of
Nidau. Others, speaking in the name of religion, overawed
their husbands and decided them: 'We will not
leave our Christian brethren of Geneva to perish
miserably,' said the Neuchâtelans to those who wished
to detain them; 'they are attacked for no other cause
than to destroy the Gospel and their liberties. <i>In such
a quarrel we will all die.</i>'</p>

<p>It was necessary to depart at once. The men who
had risen in the towns, the valleys, and the plain, to
defend, without official character, a city they had
never seen, were not armed <i>cap-à-pied</i> like the brilliant
knights of Savoy whom they were going to fight.
Some had muskets, all had swords, but they wore
neither helmet nor cuirass. The justice of their cause
was to be their breast-plate. In the evening of the 7th
October the most distant corps—that from Bienne, the
bishopric of Basle, Nidau, and the Seeland—began
their march. It is probable that they crossed the lake
of Neuchâtel to avoid the city. On arriving at the
entrance to the Val de Travers they halted, that
being the place of rendezvous. Those from Neuchâtel,
Valangin, and other places soon arrived, and all were
now assembled in that picturesque country where the
Areuse rushes out of the valley. The intrepid Wildermuth
took the command.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_632" id="Ref_632" href="#Foot_632">[632]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></div>

<p class="side">=STRUGGLE OF THE NEUCHATELANS.=</p>

<p>The little army was preparing to depart when it
saw a cavalcade approaching from the direction of
Neuchâtel: they were officers of the government sent
to prevent any of Madame's subjects from marching
to the help of Geneva. Having reached the force,
these delegates from the Sire of Prangins approached
the men under their jurisdiction, and ordered them
to return each one to his home. To go and fight
against the duke of Savoy was to put themselves in
revolt against their sovereign, who would treat them as
rebels. 'They were forbidden, and in stronger terms
than before, and with fierce threats, so that many
lost courage.' These Neuchâtelans had not at first
reflected that their government was strongly opposed
to the Reformation. Now their respect for the established
powers counterbalanced the sentiments which
had induced them to go to the help of the Gospel.
They feared the unpleasant consequences that their
disobedience might entail upon themselves and their
families. They were agitated and divided. Wildermuth
and other worthy persons perceiving that some
of them were giving way, were grieved at it; but
they did not want men whose hearts were weakened.
It was right in their eyes to protect the innocent
against the wicked; but they would not force their
convictions on their brethren. Wildermuth called out:
'Comrades, if you have not the courage to die for
Geneva, and kill as many false priests as shall offer
themselves, go about your business! It is better for
us to be few, but men of heart, as in the days of Gideon,
than to drag half-hearted ones after us.'</p>

<p>The struggle in these Neuchâtelans became more
severe. Should they go forward or should they return?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
Wildermuth had named Gideon: they remembered
how that Israelitish chief had consulted God
to know if he was to march against Midian. These
honest people, who had taken up arms in God's
cause, believed in God and in His help. All, therefore,
knelt down on the spot in order to ask of their
Sovereign Lord the road they ought to take; and that
troop, but lately so tumultuous, remained for some
minutes in deep silence. God himself was to choose
whom He would for the battle. When the prayer
was ended, each man stood up, and the energetic
captain exclaimed aloud and with great earnestness:
'Now, let those return home whom threats alarm;
but you, to whom God has given hearts to fight for
your brethren, without fear for your lives—forward!'
Three or four hundred returned home.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_633" id="Ref_633" href="#Foot_633">[633]</a></span>
It is not
doubtful that they acted thus from a spirit of obedience
to the superior authority.</p>

<p>The others, who belonged particularly to the canton
of Berne and to the Jura, had not received a similar
prohibition, and although diminished in number, they
did not hesitate. The little force was reduced by
one half, and consisted of four hundred and fifteen
men; but those who remained were filled with faith
and courage. They departed calling upon the name
of God, and praying Him to be their helper.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">WAR AND THE BATTLE OF GINGINS.<br />
 (<span class="smc">11th and 12th October 1535.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="side">=THE SECRET MARCH.=</p>

<p><span class="smc">What</span> road should this little army take? There
seemed to be no other than that through the Pays
de Vaud. But that country was occupied by the
captains of the duke of Savoy, who separated Wildermuth's
band from Geneva, and could easily oppose
him with four or five thousand men. Besides, if the
Swiss auxiliaries followed that road, they would have
to pass near Yverdun and other strong towns capable
of stopping them. 'I undertake,' Wildermuth
had said, 'to lead my companions secretly and promptly
to Geneva.' But how could he lead four to five
hundred men secretly? With that intent he had
formed a bold strange plan, by means of which he
hoped to clear the distance between Neuchâtel and
Geneva, without its being known what he was doing,
and would present himself to the Genevese in distress,
and to the Savoyards, their enemies, at a moment
when neither of them expected him. The old captain
intended to turn the Jura, and for that purpose to
cross the Val de Travers, enter Franche Comté, make
for Sainte Claude, and thence, by the pass of the
Faucille, he would descend directly upon Geneva.</p>

<p>His troops began their march: they passed through
Couvet, Môtiers, and other villages in the valley; but
they had hardly crossed the last meadows, when they
found the mountainous and steep roads, which separated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
them from Les Verrières and Pontarlier, entirely
closed by the Savoyards.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_634" id="Ref_634" href="#Foot_634">[634]</a></span>
Wildermuth, after taking
counsel with the other chiefs, resolved, instead of
turning the Jura, to march by the upper valleys.
Some objected the season, the precipices, the absence
of beaten roads; but the leaders saw no other means
of escaping the armed corps which desired to stop
them. The troop was so small that, if it fought two
or three battles before reaching Geneva, scarcely a
handful of men would enter the beleaguered city.</p>

<p class="side">=LABORIOUS MARCH.=</p>

<p>Turning, therefore, to the left, in a southerly direction,
and passing the village of Butte, the volunteers
painfully climbed the steep path which, winding between
Mont Chasseron and the Côte-aux-Fées, leads to
Sainte-Croix. They passed through this village, descended
towards Vallorbe, and then climbed again into
the high valleys of Joux.</p>

<p>These heroic adventurers were two days (Friday
and Saturday) on those cold and desert heights.
Everything was already covered with snow, which
was knee-deep, and forced them to clear the way with
unheard-of labor. We must not forget that there
were women among them. It was the coldest period
of the year, says Froment, the winter being early and
severe. Thick flakes of snow fell and covered those
brave men with a white mantle, and obliged them
to move slowly. But Wildermuth, notwithstanding
his age; Baillod, notwithstanding his small stature;
and Savoye, notwithstanding his fatigues, were fearless.
One of them always marched in front; and when
they had to encounter difficult passages, they sprang
forward with fiery ardor upon those icy bulwarks, as if
mounting to the assault.</p>

<p>At that time there were only twenty families in the
valley, and some monks of the order of the Premonstrants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
who had been settled in the twelfth century
at a place still called <i>the Abbey</i>. At the approach
of this unexpected body of 'men in white,' the inhabitants
of the heights fled in terror, with such valuables
as they could carry; and those noble champions of
independence and the Gospel could find nowhere
either men or provisions, so that famine 'pressed them
sorely.' They went into the poor gardens, but could
gather nothing to appease their hunger except 'a few
cabbage stalks and some turnips—and very little of
these,' adds the chronicler. However, they did not
lose courage: they were going to help Geneva, and
every step carried them nearer. This idea stimulated
them: the drifted snows, which often blocked
up the road, were crossed with renewed courage.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon these warriors reached the
wild lake of Les Rousses, where they turned to the
left, to make for the valley of the Leman, marching
slowly beneath long ranges of pine-trees. At length
the troop, overwhelmed with fatigue, arrived at Saint
Cergues, on the heights of the Jura overlooking Nyon,
2,800 feet above the lake. The valiant men conducted
by Wildermuth expected to find provisions in this
village; but there were no inhabitants, and no victuals.
However, as there were houses and beds too, the chiefs
determined to pass the night there, and posted sentinels
all round.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_635" id="Ref_635" href="#Foot_635">[635]</a></span></p>

<p>What were they to do next day? They might,
indeed, continue their painful road over the mountain
as far as La Faucille, whence they could descend by
way of Gex to Geneva: this, as it appeared, was
Claude Savoye's first plan; but most of his comrades,
pressed by hunger, fatigued by the snow and the difficult
roads of the Jura, proposed to descend at once
into the beautiful valley of the Leman. It was useless
to represent to them that they would infallibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
fall in with the ducal troops near Nyon; they answered
that they had been two days without eating;
how could an army, weakened by starvation, deliver
Geneva? Nothing was decided, when the advanced
sentinels brought in three young men whom they had
taken near the village. Wildermuth and the other
chiefs questioned them: they were the first human
beings who had approached them since they had
plunged into the Jura. 'We have been sent by
the people of Geneva,' said one of the three, 'to serve
you as guides. The ducal troops are assembled not
far from the mountain, to the number of four to
five thousand, horse and foot, and are preparing to
surround you, take you prisoners, and hang you.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_636" id="Ref_636" href="#Foot_636">[636]</a></span>
Follow us, and we will lead you to Geneva safe and
sound.' Claude Savoye did not know these men,
which was not a good augury; but Wildermuth and
his followers had those upright hearts which do not
easily suspect treachery in others. Too happy to find
guides, they resolved to follow the young men next
morning. It was night, and the troop prepared to
take the necessary repose.</p>

<p>There was, however, one man in that valiant band
who was not to rest. The <i>Genevan</i>, as he is generally
called in this narrative, believing that the destiny of his
country was about to be decided, could not sleep. Just
at that moment a native of the district presented himself
mysteriously at the outposts and desired to see him.
Savoye at once went to speak with him. The messenger
told him that he had come from the Seigneur d'Allinges,
one of the noblemen then collected round Monseigneur
de Lullin, governor of Vaud. D'Allinges had quitted
the castle of his family, situated on a steep hill near
Thonon, whose beautiful ruins are still the admiration of
travellers, and had joined the Savoyard gentlemen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
Being a personal friend of Savoye's, he sent to tell him
that Louis de Diesbach and Rodolph Nägueli, the envoys
of Berne, had arrived at the castle of Coppet, in order
to act as mediators in the affair. This news troubled
Savoye; did Bernese diplomacy wish to neutralize his
exertions? He might have waited until the morning,
but his character always carried him forward. He
determined to depart alone, and instantly. D'Allinges
had sent him a paper signed with his own hand, which
was to serve as a safe-conduct. After conferring with
Wildermuth, Savoye quitted Saint Cergues at the
moment when the others were about to seek the repose
of night. He descended the mountain hastily, though
not without difficulty; and, crossing rocks and penetrating
thickets, he reached the foot of the Jura at last. He
found there a fine Spanish courser, which D'Allinges
had sent for him. Savoye sprang into the saddle, and
galloped off to Coppet.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_637" id="Ref_637" href="#Foot_637">[637]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=SAVOYE GOES TO COPPET.=</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Swiss who had slept at Saint
Cergues lost no time. Stirring early on the Sunday
morning, they departed under the conduct of the three
young guides. Geneva was in imminent danger; it was
necessary to hasten to its assistance. The band passed
near the castle, whence on a sudden a world sparkling
with beauty opens before the eyes of those who have
been long shut up in the gorges of the Jura: the lake,
its rich valley peopled with smiling villages; the
magnificent Alps, in the bosom of which Mont Blanc
uplifts his kingly head; Geneva, and the towers of its
antique cathedral. Delighted to perceive the city to
whose succor they were hastening, these generous men
hailed it with joy. They descended and marched to
within a league of Nyon, at Gingins, whose castle was
then occupied by the Seigneur de Gingins, brother to
the vicar-general of Geneva. Wildermuth's followers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
tired and hungry, hoped (according to what their guides
had said) to find there in abundance the provisions of
which they stood so much in need.</p>

<p>Behind a coppice between the village and the mountain
was a ravine, worn by the waters which descend
from the hills during the heavy rains; it would scarcely
hold two persons abreast, a streamlet flowed along the
bottom, and thick underwood bordered it on both sides.
The guides of these valiant men said that they must be
careful not to go near the village, for fear the enemy
should hear of their arrival, and desired them to hide in
the ravine and wait until their return. 'We will run to
Gingins,' they said, 'and bring you back refreshments;
and then we will all set out for Geneva.' 'Go,' said
the troop; 'we will pay fairly for all you can bring us.'
The Swiss drew up noiselessly in the hollow way, and
their guides quitted them.</p>

<p class="side">=BATTLE OF GINGINS.=</p>

<p>At Gingins there was a body of the enemy composed
of Italians, Savoyards, and gentlemen and men-at-arms
of the bailiwicks of Nyon, La Côte, Gex, La
Sarraz, and other localities. The priests had preached
a crusade in those parishes.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_638" id="Ref_638" href="#Foot_638">[638]</a></span>
They had done more:
they had armed themselves<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_639" id="Ref_639" href="#Foot_639">[639]</a></span>
and marched at the head
of their villages, saying that they would not lay down
their arms until heresy was extirpated from the valley
of the Leman. They were all waiting for the Swiss,
impatient to fall upon that little band of four to five
hundred ill-armed soldiers, which they had seen descending
the mountain. The duke of Savoy, according
to the official report, had on foot to stop them three to
four thousand men. Froment, who often exaggerates
numbers, speaks of four to five thousand, and reckons
Spaniards among them. This force was divided into
corps, one of which was then at Gingins.</p>

<p>This first division, composed of fifteen hundred men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
was commanded by the Sieur de Lugrin, chief of
the Gex contingent, and an Italian, according to a
chronicler. Devoted to the Romish Church and to
his master the duke, Lugrin detested Geneva and
the Reform. Towards him the three guides had made
their way; and, being received into the castle, they
informed him of the results of the stratagem to which
they had had recourse, and told him that the Swiss
were shut up in a narrow place, where it would be
impossible for them to move, and where it would be
easy to kill them all. Lugrin immediately marched out
at the head of his men, confident of crushing at the
first blow these adventurers, exhausted by hunger and
fatigue, and of staining with heretics' blood that deep
mountain ravine.</p>

<p>The Swiss volunteers were waiting, without suspicion
and in silence, for the provisions that had been
promised them. Presently they fancied they heard
a noise: Captain Erhard and one or two others raised
their heads. Great was their surprise when, instead
of the three pretended friends bringing them food,
they saw a numerous and well-armed body of cavalry
and infantry advancing and preparing a very different
sort of banquet for them. Wildermuth without hesitation
issued from the ravine; at the same time the
Sieur de Lugrin came forward, and the two chiefs,
each accompanied by an officer, met between the
two forces. 'What is your intention?' asked Lugrin.—'To
go to Geneva,' answered Wildermuth.—'We
will not grant you the passage.'—'Very well; then
we will take it.' At this the officer who attended
Lugrin dealt Wildermuth a blow with the butt-end of
his arquebuse and knocked him down. But the Neuchâtelan
who was with him struck the Savoyard back
again and killed him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_640" id="Ref_640" href="#Foot_640">[640]</a></span>
Wildermuth sprang up immediately,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
and ran eagerly towards his followers to
give them orders to charge.</p>

<p>The soldiers who composed the troop of the duke
of Savoy were brave men, burning with enthusiasm
for the cause of Rome. They occupied a hill situated
between the ravine and the castle; they were set in
motion, and, on coming within gunshot, discharged
their muskets; but as the Swiss were still in the ravine,
the bullets passed over their heads. 'Forward!' cried
Wildermuth at this moment. In an instant his followers,
exasperated at being fooled and betrayed,
issued from the hollow way, rushed through the
hedge, drew up boldly in presence of the enemy, and
fired a volley which brought several to the ground.
Excited by rage and hunger, the valiant Switzers
did not give themselves time to reload their arms,
but rushed impetuously upon the Savoyards. They
were like bears or wolves whom hunger drives from
the mountains, to seek food in the plain. Those who
had swords fought with them; those who had muskets
used them as clubs; it was a struggle man to man,
and the conflict was frightful. In the very middle of
the fight was the heroine of Nidau, with her husband
and three sons, 'all fervent in the Gospel.' Wielding
her two-handed sword, she confronted the Savoyards.
'This family of five persons,' says Froment, 'father,
mother, and children, made a great discomfiture of
persons.' The husband was killed, the sons were
wounded, but the mother was unhurt, which was a
wonderful thing to see, says the chronicler, for nobody
attacked the enemy with more intrepidity. Another
woman, according to Stettler, rivalled her in courage,
and four Savoyards had already bitten the dust when
she fell, struck by a mortal blow.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_641" id="Ref_641" href="#Foot_641">[641]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></div>

<p class="side">=THE PRIESTS CUT DOWN.=</p>

<p>The men did not remain in the background. Fired
with martial fury, they drove their swords through
their enemies' bodies, or brained them with their
arquebuses, or else, quickly reloading their guns,
brought them down from a distance.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_642" id="Ref_642" href="#Foot_642">[642]</a></span>
Being skilful
marksmen, they picked out their victims; forty nobles,
most of them Knights of the Spoon,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_643" id="Ref_643" href="#Foot_643">[643]</a></span>
bit the dust; and
the priests paid a large tribute to death. The fanatical
anger of the clergy, who marched courageously to
battle, was met by the avenging anger of the Swiss,
who were irritated at seeing men of peace on the field
of strife. Wildermuth had pointed out 'the false
priests' to his men. 'There they are now; we must
sacrifice them as did Elijah of old.' The curés, who
had not expected such a resistance, found themselves
cut down by those terrible Helvetians, to whom two
days of suffering and the perfidy of their enemies
gave a sort of transport. An excited imagination
could alone, perhaps, secure victory to the Swiss.
One of them in particular seemed like the angel of
death. The indignation he felt at seeing the servants
of God wielding the sword, carried him away, and
twenty of them fell beneath his blows—a terrible
fulfilment of the words of Christ to Peter: <i>They that
take the sword shall perish with the sword</i>. A hundred
of these ministers of peace, turned ministers of war,
remained dead or wounded on the field.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_644" id="Ref_644" href="#Foot_644">[644]</a></span>
The noise
was frightful, and was heard a long way off. 'During
the battle,' says Froment, 'there was fierce lightning
in the air and loud thunder.' Was there a storm or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
are these words only figurative? Perhaps persons at
a distance took the flashes of the guns and the noise
of the battle for thunder and lightning.</p>

<p class="side">=SONG OF THE BERNESE SOLDIER.=</p>

<p>The defeat seemed total and decided. Wildermuth
and his followers thought they would have nothing
more to do than march into Geneva, when an unexpected
circumstance forced them to begin again. Another
<i>corps d'armée</i> of Savoye, that which was nearest,
summoned by the noise of the battle, hurried forward
to Lugrin's help. It was commanded (as it would appear)
by Michael Mangerot, baron of La Sarraz; he is
indeed the only chief of his party mentioned by some
historians.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_645" id="Ref_645" href="#Foot_645">[645]</a></span>
Mangerot, a Frenchman by extraction and
owner of the barony of La Sarraz, had been, since the
Sieur de Pontverre's death, the most formidable of the
Knights of the Spoon. Despite his efforts, none of his
men could stand before the ardor of the Swiss, and
intrepidity triumphed over numbers. Those 'tall foreigners,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_646" id="Ref_646" href="#Foot_646">[646]</a></span>
as the German chronicler styles the Savoyards,
were alarmed and discouraged; they threw away their
arms, turned their backs, and shamefully took to flight,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_647" id="Ref_647" href="#Foot_647">[647]</a></span>
leaving the field of battle covered with firelocks, breastplates,
lances, dead horses and men, among whom (says
the catholic Pierre-Fleur) were many <i>goodly personages</i>.
The loss of the Savoyards has been variously estimated
from five hundred to two thousand. In the first rank
of the victims of the fight the Swiss recognized their
perfidious guides. The latter had lost only seven men
and one woman. The hill on which these terrible blows
were dealt is still called, in memory of this battle, the
<i>Molard</i> or the <i>mound of the dead</i>. The valiant band of
the Jura, at the sight of the victims of the day, halted
on the terrible battle-field, and piously bending their
knees amid the scattered arms and blood-stained corpses
of their enemies, returned thanks to God for the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
and unexpected victory He had granted them. The
feelings which animated them have been expressed by a
Swiss poet of the time in a <i>Song of the Bernese Soldier
after the Battle of Gingins</i>, of which we give a few
verses:</p>

<p>Meanwhile the report of the battle had spread through
the whole district; all the neighboring villages were in
commotion; couriers, dispatched by Lugrin, hastily
ordered up the various corps, stationed at intervals, to
the support of their unhappy commander. These troops
hurried forward at the top of their speed. When the
Swiss had finished their thanksgiving, they looked
before them and perceived that the hostile chiefs were
busied in filled up their thinned ranks, and that fresh
bands were joining the Savoyard army. The Sire de
Lugrin and the Baron of La Sarraz at the head of these
fresh troops, supported by the old ones, were about to
attack the terrible battalion, posted on the Molard.
The Savoyards were much superior in number, and their
leaders were determined to do everything to recover
their honor and crush liberty in Geneva. The Swiss
did not hesitate; they moved forward and descended
the hill to scatter their enemies once more. The
struggle was about to be renewed. Could these famished
and exhausted men sustain the shock of soldiers burning
with desire to avenge the deaths of their comrades?</p>

<p>That was the question: a few hours would probably
answer it; but an unexpected circumstance occurred to
give a new turn to affairs.</p>

</div>

<p class="side">=DIPLOMACY AND WAR.=</p>

<p><span class="smc">Diplomacy</span> and war are the two means employed to
decide international differences. It is customary to
speak disparagingly of both, and not without cause.
All who care for their fellow-men and desire the
material and moral prosperity of nations, look upon
war as a crime against humanity; and yet a people,
invaded by an unjust and ambitious conqueror, who
desires to despoil them of their independence and
nationality, have as much right to defend themselves
as the man attacked on the highway by a robber
bent on depriving him of his purse or his life.</p>

<p>Diplomacy has its faults, like war. Its object being
to conciliate jarring interests, it falls easily into narrow
and selfish views, while it should possess that broad
wisdom which reconciles differences with impartiality.
Fully acknowledging the tact with which in ordinary
times it adheres to the path it ought to follow, we
think that it gets confused and goes astray in periods of
transition, when society is passing from one phase
to another. Seamen on a distant voyage have observed
that in certain latitudes and on certain days
the compass-needle is so agitated that the steersman
cannot make use of it to direct his course: it turns,
perhaps, to the right when it should point to the left.
This is just the case with diplomacy in those great
epochs, when, as in the sixteenth century, society is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
turning on its hinges and entering into a new sphere.
In such a case diplomacy acts first in a direction
contrary to the impulses which prepare the future:
it devotes all its care to maintain what has been,
while the normal character of the new epoch is precisely
that what has been must give place to what is to
be. Governments, naturally enough, always begin by
opposing the new developments of social, political, and
religious life. This is just what the powerful aristocracy
of Berne did at first with regard to Geneva:
we have seen it once and we shall see it again. But
if there is a bad diplomacy, there is also a good one.
Would it be out of place to remark here, that if the
château of Coppet, where some of the facts of our history
occurred, was in 1535 the seat of bad policy, it
became afterwards the centre of a liberal statesmanship?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_650" id="Ref_650" href="#Foot_650">[650]</a></span></p>

<p>The Council of Berne had kept themselves carefully
informed of the proceedings of Claude Savoye. They
had learnt that about four hundred and fifty men,
'among whom were several of My Lords' subjects,'
were crossing the Jura to succor Geneva, 'not without
danger, because of the smallness of their number.'
The Council knew that these men would have to fight
the nobles and other people of the country, brought
together from every quarter in the villages and on the
roads, to the number of more than three or four thousand.
The Bernese magistrates wished, besides, to
avoid war. They had, therefore, deputed Louis of
Diesbach and Rodolph Nägueli to the Pays de Vaud,
with instructions to order the volunteers to return
home. The two Bernese ambassadors had made their
way to the castle of Coppet, situated between Geneva
and Gingins.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_651" id="Ref_651" href="#Foot_651">[651]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></div>

<p>There was just then a great crowd in that feudal
residence, which has since been replaced by a modern
château. That place, which was one day to be the
asylum of letters and of liberty, was now, by a singular
contrast, the head-quarters of a rude and ignorant
gentry, who desired at any price to maintain feudalism,
and destroy in Geneva light, independence, and faith.
Monseigneur de Lullin, governor of the Pays de Vaud
in behalf of the duke, had taken up his abode there
with his officers and several gentlemen of the district.</p>

<p class="side">=CONFERENCE AT COPPET.=</p>

<p>On Saturday, 29th October, the day when Wildermuth
and his band reached the village of Saint Cergues,
the ambassadors from Berne had arrived at the castle
of Coppet, with the intention of coming to some understanding
with the governor of Vaud on the means of
preventing the battle that was imminent. Here they
learnt that it was nearer than they had imagined, and
that the Swiss were expected on the following morning.
The Savoyard and Bernese chiefs immediately entered
into a conference on these serious matters, and they
were still in discussion when Claude Savoye, who had
only two or three leagues to pass over, arrived on his
panting courser. The daring Genevan was fully conscious
that it was very imprudent to show himself
in the castle occupied by the commander-in-chief of
the enemies of Geneva; but it mattered not to him;
he wanted to obtain from Diesbach, at any risk, a promise
that he would not stop the troops that Claude was
bringing to the help of his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>The Sire de Lullin, being informed of his arrival,
was surprised and exasperated: there was a stormy
scene in the conference, and that clever but hasty and
passionate administrator ordered the heretical and rebellious
Genevan to be seized. The latter, escorted
by armed men, soon appeared before him in the principal
hall of the castle. To the Savoyards about the
governor, a huguenot of Geneva was a kind of monster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
which aroused alike their curiosity and horror. Savoye,
finding himself in the lion's jaws, presented the paper
that D'Allinges had sent him. This put a climax to
the governor's passion. 'By what right,' he asked that
chief, 'do you give a safe-conduct?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_652" id="Ref_652" href="#Foot_652">[652]</a></span>
Lullin, imagining
that the noble Savoyard might be a traitor in correspondence
with the enemies of his highness, ordered
both the bearer and the giver of the passport to be
locked up. The ambassadors of Berne did not think
it their duty to offer any opposition: the main thing
for them was to obtain a promise from the governor
to do all in his power to hinder the arrival of the Swiss
band. They therefore asked him to set out with them
the next morning (Sunday, October 10th) at daybreak,
to climb the mountain on whose top they hoped still to
find Wildermuth and his followers, and to make them
return.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_653" id="Ref_653" href="#Foot_653">[653]</a></span>
De Lullin would not consent to this proposition.
He wished to suffer the little Swiss force to
descend into the plain, not doubting that the soldiers
under his orders would crush them to pieces. An
opportunity offered of giving a sound lesson to those
adventurers who dared measure themselves against
the duke of Savoy: not one of those rash men should
return home. But the Bernese were still more decided
than the Savoyard governor, and after many
efforts succeeded in bringing him round to their views.
'We came to the conclusion, after much trouble,' they
said in their report, 'to go and meet them and make
them retire in confidence to their own country, at the
expense of My Lord of Savoy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_654" id="Ref_654" href="#Foot_654">[654]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=SIRE DE LULLIN'S SCHEMES.=</p>

<p>Very different thoughts occupied the dwellers in the
castle during the night which followed these deliberations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span>
While the Bernese were reflecting on the means
of preventing a battle, the governor examined his plans:
he had three to four thousand soldiers, fresh, vigorous,
and ready for the combat, while the Swiss were only four
or five hundred tired and starving men. Not to take
advantage of such an opportunity of punishing those
'heretics and mischief-makers,' appeared to him a
serious fault. Without breaking his promise, it was
possible (if he procrastinated) that the Swiss would
have time to come down from the mountains and be cut
to pieces by the Savoyards. On Sunday morning
Diesbach and Nägueli were stirring at daybreak, but
Lullin made them wait a long time for him. When he
appeared, the Bernese told him they were ready to start,
according to their agreement. 'Excuse me, gentlemen,'
said the governor, 'I must hear mass first: we catholics
never begin a journey without it.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_655" id="Ref_655" href="#Foot_655">[655]</a></span>
The mass was very
tedious; at length the Bernese, seeing the governor return,
thought their long trial was ended; but Lullin,
convinced as ever that by giving time to his troops they
would destroy Wildermuth's band, said to them:
'Gentlemen, they are about to serve up a collation: it
is impossible to start without breakfasting.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_656" id="Ref_656" href="#Foot_656">[656]</a></span>
The
collation had to be waited for: Lullin and his officers
talked much and with extreme amiability. 'Really, the
governor and his gentlemen are keeping us a little too
long this morning,' said the ambassadors,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_657" id="Ref_657" href="#Foot_657">[657]</a></span>
who were
quite wearied with these delays. At length they sat
down to table, and would no doubt have sat there long,
but that suddenly a noise like discharges of musketry
was heard. The Bernese ambassadors sprang to their
feet. There was no more room for doubt: the battle
had begun, and it was perhaps too late to fulfil their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
commission. They determined, notwithstanding, to ride
to the field of battle. The Savoyard governor, thinking
that, in consequence of all his delays, his men-at-arms
would have had time to cut the Swiss to pieces, raised no
more difficulties. They went down into the courtyard
of the castle, where for several hours thirty horses had
been stamping impatiently, and a great number of
officers, guards, and servants had been gossiping.
'Bring me the Genevan's fine Spanish horse,' said the
governor, 'and give him a donkey.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_658" id="Ref_658" href="#Foot_658">[658]</a></span>
They brought
Savoye's noble courser to the Sire de Lullin. 'Give me
also his arquebuse,' added the sharp-witted Savoyard,
'for I am sure it is a good one.' The troop fell in: the
thirty horsemen and the governor's guards surrounded
the Sire de Lullin, his officers, the Bernese, and poor
Savoye mounted on his humble quadruped. They could
not go very fast in consideration of the heretical donkey,
which Lullin would not leave behind. Claude did not
allow himself to be vexed by the ridicule with which the
governor tried to cover him, and sooner than stay at
Coppet he preferred they should laugh at him and treat
him as a common prisoner.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the governor and his escort kept advancing,
looking before them and trying if they could
not discover the Swiss. Suddenly, at a short distance
from Gingins, the strangest and most unexpected sight
met their eyes. Soldiers were flying in every direction—along
the highway, through the lanes, across the
fields: everywhere terror, confusion, and all the marks
of a signal defeat. The governor looked attentively: it
was useless trying to deceive himself, the runaways were
his own soldiers. He had expected to see the hostile
band destroyed, and he found those who were to accomplish
his designs fleeing in confusion. Incensed by
such cowardice, he approached some of the fugitives and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></span>
cried out: 'What are you doing, you poltroons? Stop!
why are you running away? Are you not ten times as
numerous as the heretics? Turn back and help me to
hang them!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_659" id="Ref_659" href="#Foot_659">[659]</a></span>
But the Savoyards, smitten with a
panic terror, passed near him almost without seeing
him. It was impossible to check their flight.</p>

<p class="side">=THE BERNESE AMBASSADORS.=</p>

<p>What was to be done at such a strange conjuncture?
There was but one course to be taken. The governor
had flattered himself with the hope of seeing the Swiss
crushed or of crushing them himself, and he had found
them victorious. Instead of having recourse to the
sword, he must make up his mind to an humble prayer.
It appears that neither Lullin nor Diesbach had any
hope of seeing a third attack succeed. The Bernese
ambassadors, commissioned by their Council to act as
mediators, must therefore advance and stop the terrible
band. De Lullin gave them some of his horsemen as
an escort, and they galloped off. At one time they were
stopped by bands of fugitives, at another they fell into
the midst of the Savoyard cavalry marching forward to
rejoin their colors: at last they arrived on the field of
battle. It was the moment when the Swiss, having
gained two victories and returned thanks to God, had
perceived that fresh troops were approaching, and were
preparing to renew the combat for a third time.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_660" id="Ref_660" href="#Foot_660">[660]</a></span>
But
at the sight of the lords of Berne they halted. This
important circumstance was about to give a new and
unexpected turn to events.</p>

<p>During this time what was the Genevan doing on his
donkey? The chroniclers do not tell us: he disappeared,
he vanished. We may conjecture that, seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
Lullin occupied in rallying his troops, still hoping that
another battle would be fought, and comprehending the
necessity of informing the Councils of what was going
on, he took advantage of the general confusion to make
for Geneva, to call his fellow-citizens to take part in this
heroic affair, and unite with the Swiss. However that
may be, the news of the battle of Gingins was brought
to Geneva by Savoye, or some other person, on the 11th
of October, the day after the fight, and the whole city
was in commotion. A deadly combat (they said) has
taken place between our liberators and our oppressors.
Four hundred Savoyards were left on the field, but the
Swiss, surrounded by numerous troops, are shut up near
Nyon, and in great danger of being cut to pieces!</p>

<p class="side">=GENEVA IN ARMS.=</p>

<p>Then arose a cry in the free city! They knew the
number of the Savoyards, and even exaggerated them;
but the Swiss must be saved at any cost. Besides,
there could be no doubt that if that little band was
destroyed, Lugrin, Mangerot, and the other chiefs
would turn against Geneva. The Genevese did not
hesitate: they had already fought many a battle, and
were ready to fight others. The strong man is he who
struggles continuously. The swimmer who ceases to
make head against the current is swept away by the
stream and disappears. The people whose liberty or
faith is threatened, must, like the strong man, struggle
until the last, for fear the rushing waters should overwhelm
him. This was the example long given by the
small city of Geneva: for ages she had been struggling
for her independence; for ages to come she struggled
for her faith.</p>

<p>Baudichon de la Maisonneuve, the captain-general,
summoned all the citizens to arms. There was no
difficulty in collecting them. They talked in Geneva
of the unheard-of difficulties which the Swiss had had
to overcome in traversing the Jura. Such sufferings,
toils, diligence, and love (said the people); such signal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">{347}</a></span>
services; the great dangers to which those brave men
have been exposed on our account—shall we repay
them only with ingratitude?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_661" id="Ref_661" href="#Foot_661">[661]</a></span>
The Genevans resolved
to deliver the Swiss or to die with them. In an instant
they were under arms; 'about two thousand men,'
says Froment, placed themselves, fully equipped, under
the orders of Baudichon de la Maisonneuve; other
documents speak of five hundred only—a number
which seems nearer the truth. Froment, probably,
counted all who took up arms: the oldest, who remained
in the city to defend it, as well as the youngest,
who left it to march to the aid of Wildermuth's band.
Eight pieces of artillery were taken out of the arsenal,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_662" id="Ref_662" href="#Foot_662">[662]</a></span>
and the army having been divided into three corps
under separate captains, Baudichon de la Maisonneuve
took the command-in-chief.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_663" id="Ref_663" href="#Foot_663">[663]</a></span></p>

<p>They departed. The soldiers of Geneva advanced
enthusiastically towards the Pays de Vaud, and
hastened their steps for fear they should arrive too
late. At the sight of Baudichon's little army the
scattered Savoyards, whom fear had brought as far as
Versoix and the neighborhood of Coppet, and who
were still trembling at the thought of yesterday's
combat, imagined that everything was lost. 'We are
all going to be killed,' they said, 'and the country
conquered.' Some fled in different directions across
the fields; others, fearing there would be no time to
run, hid themselves in the <i>courtels</i> or inclosed gardens
in the vicinity of Coppet; while others more frightened
still, wishing to put the lake between them and their
enemies, jumped into some boats moored to the bank,
and for want of oars employed their halberds, and
thus, rowing with all their might, reached the shore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
of Savoy. The Genevans, without stopping to pursue
the fugitives, arrived to within a short distance of
Coppet. 'If once we are united with the Swiss,
which can be easily done,' they said, 'our country is
saved.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_664" id="Ref_664" href="#Foot_664">[664]</a></span></p>

<p>On Sunday evening and Monday morning diplomacy
had done its work. The envoys of Berne,
arriving on the field of battle at the moment when
the Swiss were going for a third time to rush upon
the Savoyard army, had stationed themselves in front
of that band of heroes, and, faithful to the diplomatic
spirit which at that time prevailed in the councils of the
powerful republic, had said: 'Halt! On behalf of
our superiors we command you to retire. The Savoyards
are many, and quite prepared to receive you
warmly.' The lords of Berne were accustomed to
command, and their dependents to obey: they hoped,
therefore, to gain the men of Seeland. Further, Louis
of Diesbach, who had distinguished himself in the
Italian wars, and had been governor of Neuchâtel after
the Swiss had carried off its prince, Louis of Orleans,
fancied himself on that account sure of persuading
those Neuchâtelers who had remained faithful to the
enterprise. Calling them aside, he endeavored to
show them, as well as the Bernese, 'that it would
be better for them to retire with a good victory than to
run into greater danger.'—'Every effort was made
by soft words to induce the valiant champions to
return,' says Froment.</p>

<p>Diplomacy was less sure than it appeared to be of the
defeat which, as it pretended, awaited the companions
of Wildermuth. If alone they had won two victories,
what would they not do with the help of the men
of Geneva? The Savoyards were placed between
two fires, and it appeared to many that they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span>
all going to be taken and their country conquered.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_665" id="Ref_665" href="#Foot_665">[665]</a></span>
The followers of La Maisonneuve, combining with
those of Wildermuth, would expel the Savoyards from
the country and unite it either to Geneva or to
Switzerland. On the other hand, the diplomatists
said to the Swiss, that another attack would expose
them to the risk of a defeat as signal as their triumph
had been; that the battles which such brave men had
fought would not be useless; and that the Bernese,
intrusted with the task of mediation, would obtain
from Savoy a good peace in favor of Geneva. 'See,
you have been two or three days without eating,'
added Diesbach; 'two battles have exhausted your
strength. Make your way to the village of Founex,
above Coppet; abundant supplies are waiting for
you, and there you shall receive our last directions.'
Thus spoke the lords of Berne.</p>

<p class="side">=THE SWISS MARCH TO FOUNEX.=</p>

<p>But the intrepid men of the Seeland and Neuchâtel
contingent were 'greatly angered;' they asked whether
they should let themselves be seduced by 'soft words'
or 'foolish fears;' they laughed at the attempt to
frighten them with the Savoyards, who were (they
said) so scared that they did not know what they
were about! But the ambassadors did not cease
their exertions, and already the Swiss were hesitating.
A number of the Bernese did not wish to put themselves
in opposition to the government of their canton;
and the Neuchâtelers thought that as it was the lords
of Berne who had supported Neuchâtel in the work
of Reform, they would not be likely to abandon
Geneva. The greater number, exhausted and worn
out by two days' journeying in the snow and one day of
hard fighting, and having had no other food than a
few turnips, were of opinion, that as they were weakened
by hunger, and the food was offered them at
Founex which had not been given them at Gingins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
it was quite natural to go there. Besides, that was
not relinquishing their design. Was not Founex on
the road to Geneva? The ambassadors became more
urgent, and at last all marched off, leaving, not without
regret, the glorious field of battle. 'And so they came
to Founex, where they were supplied with meat and
drink,' say the registers of Geneva.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_666" id="Ref_666" href="#Foot_666">[666]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bernese lords saw them march off, and when
the last had passed them, they breathed freely, turned
their bridles, and with their escort took the road to
Coppet, much pleased at having succeeded so well.
But they were not yet at the end of their troubles.
They had hardly proceeded half way when they were
exposed to a new danger. A Savoyard squadron,
about sixty strong, was approaching: on coming
within a short distance of the Bernese, the horsemen
set spurs to their horses and dashed upon the
ambassadors and their escort, shouting out, 'Slay,
slay!' One of them, placing his musket on Diesbach's
breast, was preparing to kill him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_667" id="Ref_667" href="#Foot_667">[667]</a></span>
In the midst of
the alarm that had seized them, the Bernese diplomatists
began to understand that it is not wise to choose
one's friends badly. However, Diesbach escaped with
a fright, one of his escort having turned the musket
aside. The explanations of the ambassadors did not
satisfy the Savoyards, who were a reinforcement of
cavalry on their way to Gingins, to help their countrymen
to take satisfaction for the defeat which their
friends had suffered. They were furious, and swore
they would avenge their comrades murdered in two
affairs by the Bernese. Convinced that these patricians
of Berne were in a plot with the victors, they
made them prisoners, ordered them to get off their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
horses, and forcing them to march on foot between
them, as if they were robbers, intended to put them
in prison at Nyon. At last, however, after fresh
parleying, those rude horsemen found out that they
were taking away the governor's friends, and, intimidated
by the knowledge, they hastened to release the
envoys, who remounted their horses and rode off to
Coppet. It was late when they arrived at the castle,
where serious matters awaited them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_668" id="Ref_668" href="#Foot_668">[668]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=DIPLOMATIC TRICKERY.=</p>

<p>The next morning, Monday, 11th of October, the
governor, the two Bernese deputies, and several
gentlemen, having met at breakfast, were discussing
what was to be done, 'as they sat eating, drinking,
and banqueting,' when an officer entered and informed
them that a Genevese army, commanded by De la
Maisonneuve, was approaching the castle. The whole
place was in confusion. The Savoyard army was so
far off that the Genevese might by a bold stroke seize
the governor of Vaud, with his officers and gentlemen,
and even the envoys of Berne, and carry them away
to Geneva. Such a blow would have been quite in
harmony with Baudichon's daring character; if he had
been able to make the bishop quit Geneva, he might
easily (thought many) deliver his city from the lords
who were conspiring at Coppet. What could be done
to stop him? Those gentlemen invented 'an old
trick of war,' says the chronicle, according to which
every man, not in a position to resist his adversaries,
makes a pretence of wishing for peace, either to gain
time or to draw his enemy into a snare. At any price
the men of Geneva must be induced to return. Diplomacy,
therefore, recommenced its stratagems. The
governor of Vaud, although more determined than
ever to destroy that restless city, commissioned some
of his gentlemen to go and inform the Genevan commander
that they were in conference, and that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
were even ready to sign the preliminaries of a peace advantageous
to the city; but that, in order to complete
the negotiations, they wanted three deputies from
Geneva.</p>

<p>The gentlemen of Savoy, the bearers of this message,
having arrived at the Genevan outposts, and being conducted
to De la Maisonneuve, discharged their pacific
mission. Opinions were divided. Some suspected a
trick, and contended that if the troops of Geneva and
Neuchâtel could meet, the independence of Geneva
would be secured. They therefore did all they could to
oppose the conference; but others affirmed that they
could trust M. de Diesbach; and that the best course
would be to send three of their men, to ascertain the
sincerity of these proposals of peace and then return and
make their report. 'Who will guarantee their return?'
cried those who feared the Savoyard governor. Upon
this the gentlemen of the Sire de Lullin pledged their
'faith and promise' that no harm should befall the delegates.
The worthy Genevans, being unwilling to
suspect perjury, gave way, and selected as their envoys
Jean d'Arlod, Thibaut Tocker, and Jean Lambert.</p>

<p class="side">=GENEVAN ENVOYS IMPRISONED.=</p>

<p>When this deputation reached the castle, the Sire de
Lullin and his guests were again occupied in eating,
drinking, and banqueting. This intimacy of the lords
of Berne with the enemies of Geneva displeased d'Arlod
and his colleagues; but all the same they resolved to
discharge their mission faithfully. They had not long
to wait before they learnt that the Savoyard chiefs had
no idea of peace; and that they wanted to crush that
sect, rebellious to the laws of the Church,—that sect
which they had so long loaded with their contempt,
which dismissed the priests, declared its independence
of the pope, made laws contrary to those which for centuries
had governed Christendom, and pretended to
treat with Rome as an equal. Those huguenots had
deprived the saints of the honors they had enjoyed, destroyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></span>
the images, abolished the mass, and interdicted
the sacred rites. What was then to be done, except to
treat their deputies as criminals? The Genevan plenipotentiaries
asked to see the preliminaries of the peace
which it was desired to conclude with them. The Sire
de Lullin could not believe his ears, and, bursting with
anger, he flew into a passion at their audacity: 'What!
rebels dare ask to know the <i>preliminaries</i>!' He ordered
them to be seized. It was useless for the Genevans to
appeal to the promise that had been given them; Lullin
would not hear a word, and, desiring war at any price,
was determined to trample under foot the inviolability
with which the law of nations invests internuncios.
The three Genevans were 'tied and fastened like robbers.'—'Take
them to the castle of Chillon,' said Lullin,
'where they will be able to talk with M. de Saint
Victor (Bonivard), who has already spent six years there
for the business of Geneva.' The three noble citizens
were carried off and shut up in the fortress of Chillon.
It was the opinion then at Coppet, as it had been a
century before at Constance, 'that no one is bound to
keep faith with heretics.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_669" id="Ref_669" href="#Foot_669">[669]</a></span></p>

<p>De la Maisonneuve and his officers waited impatiently
for the return of their delegates; the time slipped away,
and they did not appear. The fear of deplorable events
began to disturb the least credulous minds. 'It is
probable,' said some, 'that this is a <i>going</i> which will
have no <i>returning</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_670" id="Ref_670" href="#Foot_670">[670]</a></span>
The commander sent the trumpeter,
Ami Voullier, to inquire what was going on—a duty
belonging in those days to his office. Voullier, either
because he inclined to the worse side, or was bribed by
the enemy, or suffered himself to be deceived by some
crafty Savoyard, returned and reported that the
gentlemen at the castle were occupied in drawing up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">{354}</a></span>
articles of peace; and that the place was not undefended,
for he had seen in the vineyards round about it more
soldiers than vinestocks. He added that, as peace was
about to be concluded, the presence of armed men who
were not to fight was useless, and that the best thing
would be for every man to return home. The most
pacific of the Genevans, believing their delegates to be
really occupied in drawing up a real treaty, insisted upon
returning to the city. An experienced and clear-sighted
commander, a man of superior mind, would not have
been satisfied with the trumpeter's report. He would
not have left the place without being put in direct
communication with the three plenipotentiaries. If he
had discovered the governor's perfidy, he would have
been able, especially with the support of the Swiss, to
surround the castle, capture the governor and his suite,
and the Bernese themselves, and not release them
until he had obtained the deliverance of his envoys.
Even if it were true that they were discussing a treaty
of peace, would it not have been of advantage for the
forces of Geneva to remain near Coppet to add strength
to the representations of their delegates? De la
Maisonneuve was a good citizen, a good protestant, and
a soldier, but he was neither a great general nor a keen
diplomatist. Besides, a noble simplicity of heart does
not suspect dissimulation. Those proud huguenots,
who erred sometimes through too much violence, erred
now through too much simplicity. It was decided that,
as peace was going to be signed, the Genevans should
return home. The corps started for Geneva. This
error weighed heavily upon Baudichon de la Maisonneuve,
and troubled him all the rest of his life.</p>

<p class="side">=THE SWISS VOLUNTEERS DUPED.=</p>

<p>The skilful diplomatists assembled at Coppet, having
thus got rid of the Genevese, undertook to rid themselves
in a similar manner of the Swiss cantoned at
Founex. Some of them, going to Wildermuth's little
army, said: 'Peace is concluded. All soldiers must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></span>
now return home. The city of the huguenots will now
be free. You have fairly acquired the right to enjoy
repose. Moreover, the governor of Vaud undertakes
to pay the expense of your journey.' The Swiss gave
way like the Genevans. An heroic victory was succeeded
by a diplomatic defeat. If the honest have their
power, the cunning have theirs also. It is the fate of
humble and sincere individuals and nations to be sometimes
mystified by the adroit and powerful. As regards
the Swiss, the last verse of the war-song of Gingins
shows that, if they turned their steps homewards, it was
because of their conviction that the deliverance of
Geneva was secured.</p>

<p>'Finish the matter,' we said, 'in order that the
city of Geneva may be delivered—that is all we ask;
that peace may be secured to her, so that the Word
of God may be preached within her walls in all liberty,
that the Lord's fold may be saved, and then we shall
return joyful to our homes.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_671" id="Ref_671" href="#Foot_671">[671]</a></span></p>

<p>But these strains were the illusions of honorable
minds. If arms had wrought the triumph of right
and liberty at Gingins, policy had procured the triumph
of fraud and despotism at Coppet.</p>

<p>Still one question arises. Was the battle of Gingins
useless? No, for it saved Geneva. The bravery
of the Swiss and their victory were deeply imprinted
in the minds of the population of Vaud. They talked
of it in villages and castles, and even in Savoy. Accordingly,
some months later, when an army sent by
the Councils of Berne appeared in the country, no
one dared measure himself with it, the bravery of
the Swiss still freezing all hearts with terror.</p>

<p>Louis of Diesbach and his colleagues, who arrived at
Geneva the day after the treason of Coppet, proposed
to the council a treaty with the duke, stipulating,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">{356}</a></span>
among other things, that the traitors of Peney should
be restored to their privileges. 'What!' said the
premier Syndic, 'you have sent back those who were
coming to our help, and you claim to place within
our walls those who will never cease from making
war on us!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_672" id="Ref_672" href="#Foot_672">[672]</a></span>
De la Maisonneuve, discovering that
the trumpeter had made a false report, and that his
troops, instead of returning to Geneva, ought to have
marched upon Coppet, could not contain his sorrow
and rage. He declared the man guilty of high-treason,
and many persons joined with him in demanding
Ami Voullier's head. His life was, however, spared,
but he lost the esteem of his fellow-citizens.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_673" id="Ref_673" href="#Foot_673">[673]</a></span></p>

<p>The indignation of the magistrates and of the chiefs
of the soldiery was trifling compared with the anger
of the people. The thought that the envoys had been
shut up within the walls of Chillon made all their
hearts burn. 'Let us make reprisals,' said the relatives
of the victims to the syndics, 'and to make sure
that they will restore us our fellow-citizens, let us
seize hostages who are as good as they.' Three notable
men, at that time within the reach of the Genevans—M.
de Sales, the Bastard of Wufflens, and M. de
Montfort—were laid hold of.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_674" id="Ref_674" href="#Foot_674">[674]</a></span>
The last-named was
a monk of the convent of St. Jean, situated on the
heights bathed by the blue waters of the Rhone, at
the gates of Geneva, although within the duke's territories.
The people do not weigh the claims of justice
so calmly as wise men in council. The flames which
burnt in every heart broke out all of a sudden.
There was shouting and assembling. The popular
waves rose higher from street to street, tossing and
foaming. 'Shall we leave at the very gates of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">{357}</a></span>
city,' was the cry, 'a building whence the enemy can
make his artillery bear upon us?' The crowd rushed
to St. Jean, scaled the walls, seized De Montfort,
climbed on the roof, broke, demolished, and threw
down everything, and did not stop until the convent
was in ruins. The crime of Coppet produced the
execution at St. Jean. Popular indignation did not
reflect that in all states, and especially in republics,
nothing should be done except by the law.</p>

Stettler says that the Swiss had already started for Geneva
when the Bernese arrived; and Ruchat and others say the same.
On reading the manuscript registers of the Council of Geneva, it
is seen that the report of Messieurs de Berne states expressly the
contrary; and Froment corroborates this report, p. 196.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XI.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">MOVEMENTS FOR THE ATTACK AND DEFENCE OF GENEVA—FAITH AND HEROISM.<br />
 (<span class="smc">From the beginning of November 1535 to the end of January 1536.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="side">=GENEVA BLOCKADED.=</p>

<p><span class="smc">A reverse</span> is not always an evil; it may sometimes
lead to a decisive victory. There were few regular
troops among those who had been beaten at Gingins,
which made the defeat a lesson by which the duke
of Savoy might profit. He resolved, in effect, to
benefit by it, to bring up veteran soldiers, to place
a distinguished general at their head, and thus to
crush that rebellious city which presumed to set up
a religion unknown at Rome. But as these troops
were not ready, Charles III. ordered the chiefs of
the great valley of the Leman to exact of their vassals
the military service which they owed. The nobles
of that district were persuaded that they would easily
triumph over Geneva, if the Swiss did not come to
their help; and as that was not likely, the hatred
felt against the city, and the hope of enriching
themselves with its spoil, induced a great number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
liegemen to rally round the banners of their lords.
About the end of October the Sire de Lullin took
his measures for blockading Geneva. Mangerot, baron
of La Sarraz, a prompt, violent, obstinate man, filled
with contempt for the reformation of the Church and
the liberty of the citizens, was placed at the head of the
attack. On the 1st of November these armed bands
occupied certain villages and small towns which
formed a kind of circle round the city, and began to
plunder, burn, and kill all who fell into their hands.
Famine and the cold, which was very severe that
year, soon caused distress in the city. The churches
were filled with old men, women and children, and
even armed men. 'There is no resource and refuge
left but God alone,' said Farel from the pulpit, and
voices were heard responding to him from the midst
of the congregation, 'In Him alone we place our trust.'
If a musket-shot was heard, or shouts, or the drum,
the armed men left immediately, but 'without noise
or confusion; nobody else moved from the sermon,'
and the service was not interrupted. As the firing
grew hotter without, those who had remained in the
temple cried to God that 'not to man's arm did they
look for deliverance, but to His great faithfulness.'
One night, the Genevans, startled out of their sleep and
rising hastily, found the city surrounded by fires
kindled by the men-at-arms of Savoy, with the intention
of giving them light for the assault, and heard the
bells of the convents and chapels all round ringing
as loud as possible to increase their terror. The
citizens fought valiantly, and the enemy was once more
repulsed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_675" id="Ref_675" href="#Foot_675">[675]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the blockade was still maintained round the city,
and no one could tell whence succor would arrive.
One day a messenger coming from France succeeded in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
making his way through the troops which surrounded
Geneva: he was the bearer of a letter conceived in
these terms:</p>

<p>'<i>You will certainly receive some mule loads of good
and salable merchandise, and they will be there one of
these days.</i></p>

<div class="foot">
<div class="right2">'<span class="smc">Pierre Croquet.</span>'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_676" id="Ref_676" href="#Foot_676">[676]</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>The letter was handed to Maigrot the Magnificent.
''Tis good,' he said, 'salvation comes to us from
France.'</p>

<p class="side">=VOLUNTEERS FROM FRANCE.=</p>

<p>At that moment certain evolutions were taking
place in the policy of the great powers of Europe,
which might favor the deliverance of Geneva. 'If
you desire Milan, take Turin,' said the crafty Clement VII.
to the king of France. As Sforza, the last duke
of Milan, was dead, Francis I., in order to follow up
the pontiff's advice, had to seek some kind of pretext
for declaring war against his uncle, the duke of Savoy.
There was one which presented itself quite naturally.
'Charles IV. oppresses Geneva,' said some. 'Let
France oppose his laying hands on it, and war will be
certain.' Francis I., who was then at Lyons and negotiating
with Charles V., saw that he could not support
Geneva openly; but permitted the Sieur de Vérey,
a French nobleman, to raise a troop of volunteers.
Men, charmed with the new liberties, flocked with
enthusiasm to his banners. Many printers in particular
joined the band. The printers in those times
remarked that the Reformation produced not only
authors who wrote for the people, but a people who
read their books with eagerness; and accordingly they
were ready to fight for it. Francis I. was not content
to look on, but gave Vérey the company of Jean Paoli,
son of the Sieur de Ceri, the old captain of the Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
bands, consisting of 'excellent cavalry and valiant
personages.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_677" id="Ref_677" href="#Foot_677">[677]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the city was going to ruin: there was no
money to pay the soldiers. What was to be done? In
many old houses Genevan coins were found, bearing the
sun as a symbol with this device—<i>Post tenebras spero
lucem</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_678" id="Ref_678" href="#Foot_678">[678]</a></span>
These pieces proved that the city of Geneva
had once possessed the right of coining money—a right
of which the prince-bishops had deprived her. Claude
Savoye received instructions to issue a new coinage,
and was forthwith supplied with silver crosses, chalices,
patens, and other sacred utensils. The coins he struck
bore on one side the key and eagle (the arms of Geneva),
with the legend, <i>Deus noster pugnat pro nobis</i>, 1535, 'Our
God fighteth for us;' and on the reverse, <i>Geneva civitas</i>.
The following year another coinage was issued which, in
addition to the ordinary device, <i>Post tenebras lucem</i>, bore
these words of Isaiah and St. Paul, <i>Mihi sese flectet omne
genu</i>, 'Unto me every knee shall bow,' the monogram
of Jesus, I. H. S., being in the centre. Geneva did not
believe in its own victory only, but in the victory of God,
whose glory, hidden until then, would be magnified
among all nations.</p>

<p class="side">=CONFERENCE AT AOSTA.=</p>

<p>While Francis I. was stealthily aiding Geneva, the
powerful republic of Berne was negotiating in its favor.
Some of its statesmen crossed the Saint-Bernard on their
way to the town of Aosta, where the duke of Savoy was
to meet them. Berthold Haller, the reformer, and the
other Bernese pastors, had gone in a body to the council
and conjured them to make an appeal to the people for
the deliverance of Geneva. 'They are ready,' said the
ministers, 'to sacrifice their goods and their lives to
uphold the Reformation in that city.' The lords of
Berne, desirous of taking at least one step, sent a deputation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
to the duke, and commissioned their general,
Francis Nägueli, who was at its head, to support the
cause of Geneva. Son of one of the most distinguished
chiefs of the Swiss bands, Francis had grown up in the
camp, and like Wildermuth, had made his first campaign
in the wars of Italy in 1511. 'He was a man at twenty,'
people said. His features bronzed by a southern sun
presented a mixture of energy, acuteness, and antique
grandeur, and the Christian piety by which he was
animated imparted to them a great charm.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_679" id="Ref_679" href="#Foot_679">[679]</a></span>
P. d'Erlach,
Rodolph of Diesbach, and the chancellor P. Zyro
accompanied him. Crossing the mountains with difficulty—it
was in the latter half of November—and
braving rain, cold, and snow,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_680" id="Ref_680" href="#Foot_680">[680]</a></span>
the ambassadors arrived
at last at the city of Aosta. The duke was not there;
they were invited to push on to Turin, but the lords of
Berne replied that they would wait for the duke at the
foot of the glaciers. The Bernese and their suite took
advantage of this delay to enter into conversation with
the inhabitants, and spoke to them fearlessly of Holy
Scripture and the usurpations of the Roman bishop.</p>

<p>At last Charles III. arrived and the conference was
opened. 'First of all,' said the Bernese, 'we require
you to leave the citizens of Geneva at liberty to obey
the Word of God, as the supreme authority of faith.'
The duke, surrounded by the servants of Rome and
urged particularly by Gazzini, bishop of Aosta, declared
that he could not concede their demand without the
consent of the emperor, the permission of the pope, and
the decision of a general council. 'I ask you once
more,' said Nägueli, 'to leave the Genevans free to
profess their faith.' 'Their faith,' ejaculated Charles,
'what is their faith?' 'There are Bibles enough,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">{362}</a></span>
I think, in Savoy,' answered Nägueli; 'read them, and
you will discover their faith.' The duke asked for a
truce of five or six months to come to an understanding
on the matter with the emperor and the pope. The
ambassadors, recrossing the snows of those lofty
mountains, returned to Berne and made their report.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_681" id="Ref_681" href="#Foot_681">[681]</a></span></p>

<p>During this time the Savoyard troops had drawn
closer round Geneva, and on the 7th of December had
attacked the city. Rodolph Nägueli, the general's
brother, communicated to the council the offer made by
Charles III. of a five months' truce. But the Genevese
replied: 'How can the duke observe a truce of five
months, when he cannot keep one of twenty days? He
makes the proposal in order to starve us out. We will
negotiate no more with him, except at the sword's
point. All delays are war to us. Give us your assistance,
honored lords. We ask it not only in the name
of our alliances, but in the name of the love you owe to
your poor brethren in Christ. Do what you may, the
hour is come, and our God will fight for us.' The
herald was sent through the city, ordering every
citizen to get his arms ready and to muster round
their captains.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_682" id="Ref_682" href="#Foot_682">[682]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=MAISONNEUVE'S EXERTIONS.=</p>

<p>At the same time Baudichon de la Maisonneuve,
who was then in Switzerland, employed all his energies
to awaken the sympathy of the people in favor of
Geneva. At Berne, he sought support among the
middle classes, among those who loved the Gospel
and liberty, feeling persuaded that they would carry the
magistrates with them. He was indefatigable and
pleaded the cause of his country in private houses,
in society, and in the council. He labored as if desirous
of repairing the fault he had committed in allowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>
himself to be outwitted at Coppet by the Savoyard
statesmen. The government of Lullin, being informed
of the exertions of the Genevese citizen, ordered him to
be seized when he attempted to cross the territory of
Vaud on his return home. De la Maisonneuve was
filled with joy, for he was succeeding in his efforts; the
good cause was gradually gaining the upper hand in
Berne; but one thing distressed him: he received
no news from Geneva, and could not go there to
communicate his great expectations to his fellow-countrymen.
'I have received no news at all from
you,' he wrote on the 9th of December to the council,
'no more than if I were a Jew or a Saracen. If I could
pass, I would not remain here; but I am warned that I
am watched on all sides, as a mouse is watched by a cat.
Know that those of Basle and other cantons who belong
to the Gospel are willing to employ all their power to
help us. In a short time you will see wonders and how
God will work.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_683" id="Ref_683" href="#Foot_683">[683]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the severity of the weather had become
extreme; the nobles who were blockading Geneva—the
De Montforts, De Gingins, De Burchiez, and
others—determined to go into winter quarters with
their men. The Sire Mangerot de la Sarraz vainly
conjured them to remain. 'We are compelled to
return,' they said. The Genevans began to breathe.
Their enemies were departing, and the refugee Maigrot
kept telling them that friends from France were
about to 'arrive in numbers and full of courage.'
The citizens began thus to discern some gleams of
light through the darkness which surrounded them.</p>

<p>In effect the Sieur de Montbel de Vérey, with his
seven hundred foot-soldiers and four hundred horse,
dispatched secretly by Francis I., with a personal object,
to the support of Geneva, had arrived in the valley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
of St Claude. This was in the middle of December.
The intrepid Mangerot, disgusted at the cowardice of
his allies, had remained alone at his post; and he had
done so specially to oppose the French. Taking four
hundred men with him, he climbed the mountains,
and found from ten to twenty feet of snow in the
upper valleys. De Vérey's Italian cavalry could not
advance and his foot-soldiers were almost frozen. All
of a sudden, at the turn of a road, a discharge of
musketry spread terror and disorder in that disorganized
band. The intrepid De Vérey, accompanied
by seven horsemen, dashed through the enemy, and
on the 14th of December eight men, the only survivors
of nearly twelve hundred, arrived at the gates
of Geneva.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_684" id="Ref_684" href="#Foot_684">[684]</a></span></p>

<p>Nägueli, the Bernese deputy, fully comprehending
the gravity of the circumstances, departed the same
day. They soon learnt with regret that all the Sieur
de Vérey's men-at-arms had either been cut to pieces
or dispersed in the snows and forests of the mountains;
at the same time La Sarraz, proud of his
victory, once more beleaguered the city, and swore that
he would put an end to its independence and heresy.
The fortunes of Geneva were overcast, and some
asked if this was how God saved those who followed
His Word. On the 17th of December, at the
moment when the frightful news arrived, William
Farel went to the council and said: 'Most honored
lords, the chief thing is that we should all be converted
to God, and that you should make arrangements
that the people should renounce sin and hear the Word
of the Lord. It is because God knows that it is of
no use to entice by mildness those who sleep, that He
now strikes you with great blows of His hammer in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">{365}</a></span>
order to arouse you.' That holy exhortation made a
deep impression on the council, and the same day the
officers of the state published throughout the city
that 'all men should go on the morrow and other
days to the church of St. Pierre and invoke the help
of God.' The next morning, the Genevese, assembling
before the Most High, cried to Him by the
voices of His servants.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_685" id="Ref_685" href="#Foot_685">[685]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CLAIMS OF FRANCIS I.=</p>

<p>A still greater danger threatened Geneva. The
Frenchman, De Vérey, although beaten, desired none the
less to attain the end for which he had been sent. He
had very winning ways with the Genevese. 'The king
of France,' he said, 'takes your business to heart; he
will send a stronger force to save you, for he loves
Geneva with a strong affection.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_686" id="Ref_686" href="#Foot_686">[686]</a></span>
Meantime, gentlemen,
to give him occasion to expel your enemy, it would be
advisable that you should grant him some pre-eminence
in your city. The king asks for nothing but to be called
the <i>Protector of your liberties</i>. He desires to help you to
become strong.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_687" id="Ref_687" href="#Foot_687">[687]</a></span>
The council ruminated, discussed,
and calculated all these matters well.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_688" id="Ref_688" href="#Foot_688">[688]</a></span>
On the one hand,
they did not want the protection of France; on the
other, they felt the need of her support. They temporized.
'First expel our enemies,' they said, 'and we
will then see how to show our respect for the king.'
'We had hoped to find you better disposed,' said De
Vérey, who was not satisfied with <i>respect</i> for his master.
'Think upon it, gentlemen, think upon it.' He went
away very discontented. But the citizens spoke out
more frankly than the council. A despotic king, what a
protector for their liberty! A king who hangs and burns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">{366}</a></span>
evangelical Christians, what a protector for their faith!
Bold tribunes, and especially the brothers Bernard,
stood forth, and demanded that if their country must
perish, it should perish free. Let us write to the king,
then said the council, that the Genevese offer him their
humble services, 'but <i>without any subjection</i>.' The little
city, on the verge of the abyss, rejected the hand of the
powerful monarch which alone was stretched out to
save them. Six days later (December 23d) the duke of
Savoy ordered the commanders of his forces on this
side of the mountains 'to do their duty.' It was resolved
in Geneva that in case of assault all the citizens,
and even the old men, women, and children, should
repair to the walls.</p>

<p class="side">=JESSE'S HEROIC DEFENCE.=</p>

<p>The year 1536 opened, and on the 3d of January the
Savoyard garrisons of Lancy, Confignon, Saconnex
beyond the Arve, and Plan-les-Ouates, castles situated
between the Rhone and the Arve, as well as those of
Gaillard and Jussy, fortresses between the Arve and
the lake, advanced simultaneously against the city.
At the head of the last troop was Amblard de Gruyère,
a fervent catholic and hot-headed feudalist, who determined
first to take possession of the church of our
Lady of Grace on the Arve, and thus acquire an important
position a few minutes distant from the city
and the Savoyard territory. Pierre Jessé and three
other valiant huguenots had thrown themselves into the
tower. Amblard advanced, and standing at the foot of
the wall, called to them: 'Surrender! on the honor of
a gentleman your lives shall be spared.' Jessé answered:
'I would sooner surrender to yon pig-drivers,
for you gentlemen have no honor.' Upon this Amblard
de Gruyère opened a warm fire upon his adversaries.
The latter were not alarmed; they stood firm, and
believed, with Farel, that a man armed with divine
strength is equipped from head to foot. They threw
down huge stones from the top of the tower upon their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
assailants; they discharged their arquebuses and killed
several of the enemy. Amblard ordered an assault,
broke down the iron door which closed the staircase,
and rushed up it, sword in hand; but just as he reached
the door which opened into the belfry, a ball knocked
him back upon the people behind him. Although reinforcements
came up one by one to the support of the
assailants, the latter, seeing their captain fall, 'had a
great fright and fear.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_689" id="Ref_689" href="#Foot_689">[689]</a></span>
All night long the four huguenots
made fire-signals to their friends in the city, to let
them know that they would hold out until death.
Meantime the attacking party did not relax their hold.
Climbing the narrow stairs, they placed torches against
the floor of the tower under the feet of the four huguenots,
and set the timbers on fire. The Savoyards,
thinking that the Genevans would be burnt to death,
then retired, 'carrying off the body of their captain and
others who had fallen.' The undaunted huguenots,
already feeling the fire, rushed down the stairs through
the flames, and were saved, with nothing burnt but
their beards.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_690" id="Ref_690" href="#Foot_690">[690]</a></span>
Jessé was afterwards made a member of
the council.</p>

<p>Still, if one attack failed, it paved the way for
others; and new troops were moved up against the
city. The council deliberated on the course to be
pursued, and two alternatives were proposed. Farel
demanded, for the preservation of the city, that the
inhabitants should put their trust in God, and that
prayers should be offered from every heart for peace
and unity, not for Geneva only, but for all Christendom.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_691" id="Ref_691" href="#Foot_691">[691]</a></span>
Balard proposed another remedy: 'Let mass
be publicly celebrated once more,' he said; 'the mass
is an expiation that will render God propitious to
us.'—'The mass is not worth a straw,' exclaimed a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">{368}</a></span>
huguenot.—'If it is so,' retorted a catholic, 'the death
and passion of Jesus Christ are good for nothing.'
At these words the assembly became greatly excited.
'Blasphemy!' exclaimed some. 'Balard has spoken
blasphemy! He is a heretic. All who maintain the
sacrifice of the host nullify the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.'
The council put an end to the discussion by resolving
'that the priests should prove that the preachers spoke
falsely, or else that they should go to the sermons
and convince themselves that the ministers spoke the
truth.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_692" id="Ref_692" href="#Foot_692">[692]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 12th of January the gates of the city were
bricked up, the openings in the walls were filled in,
and the armed men held themselves in readiness.
The hostile force was advancing in three divisions—one
between the lake and the Arve, a second between
the Arve and the Rhone, and a third between the
Rhone and the lake. About ten o'clock at night cries
of alarm were heard from the walls; the Savoyards
were placing their ladders on the southern side, while
the Baron de la Sarraz and his troop had already got
into the fosse on the north-west side. The Genevans
hastened bravely to the defence, and threw down both
ladders and soldiers. The next day the agitated
council ordered these words to be entered in the
minute-book of their meetings: '<i>They assaulted us
vigorously, but God, to whom belongs all the honor,
repelled them</i>.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_693" id="Ref_693" href="#Foot_693">[693]</a></span>
From that time the Savoyards, 'more
inflamed than ever, scarcely missed a night without
making an attack.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_694" id="Ref_694" href="#Foot_694">[694]</a></span>
They desired to do more.</p>

<p>On the 24th of January the garrisons of Jussy and
Gaillard, amounting to 600 or 800 men, of whom 100
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">{369}</a></span>
were horsemen, reinforced by a large number of peasants,
took up a position between Chene and Cologny,
a little above the ravine of Frontenex. A hundred
footmen and forty horse made a sortie from Geneva,
and a great number of boys from fourteen to sixteen
years old accompanied them. This small body at once
attacked the large one, and in a short time the wide
plain between Frontenex and Ambilly was covered with
fugitives and corpses. Not less than two hundred had
fallen. The victors returned in triumph from the <i>War
of Cologny</i>, through a crowd of citizens, who went out
to meet them and welcome them with shouts of joy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_695" id="Ref_695" href="#Foot_695">[695]</a></span></p>

<p>But if the weak people of Geneva repulsed little
armies, how would they resist when the grand army
came?</p>

 (<span class="smc">January to February 1536.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="side">=GENEVA IN PERIL.=</p>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> duke of Savoy was preparing to aim more
decisive blows at Geneva. He desired to satisfy the
ancient ambition of his house, and to crush a city
which believed itself called upon to divorce from Rome
the populations scattered around her. In this he was
animated by his wife, Beatrice, a Portuguese princess,
who was inspired by that religious fanaticism which
generally distinguishes the women of the Iberian
peninsula. The cities of Asti, Ivrea, and Verceil had
fallen into the hands of the house of Savoy, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">{370}</a></span>
Geneva was to experience the same fate. The moment
seemed favorable. Charles V. was preparing to destroy
protestantism: lansquenets, recruited by the emperor's
brother, were arriving from Germany, and the army
which Charles himself was bringing back from Africa,
was moving towards the Alps. Letters from Berne
announced that the emperor and the duke would begin
by reducing Geneva, reformed Switzerland would
follow, and last of all Lutheran Germany. Thus the
subjection of the city of the huguenots formed part of a
general plan. That mighty monarch, upon whose
dominions the sun never set, had determined to abolish
the Reformation, beginning with this city.</p>

<p class="side">=GIANGIACOMO DE MEDICI.=</p>

<p>Charles III. had learnt that what had paralyzed his
former efforts was the error he had committed by not
sending disciplined troops against the huguenot city.
He therefore determined on this occasion to select none
but veteran soldiers and to place them under the orders
of one of the boldest captains of the age, whose march
should be accompanied with plunder and devastation.
A person of low birth, who had settled at Milan, had
acquired a small fortune by his industry. This man,
Bernardino Medici (a name not to be confounded with
that of the Medicis of Florence) had two sons, Giovanni
Angelo, who became Pope under the name of
Pius IV., and Giangiacomo, a rash, enterprising,
treacherous, and cruel young man, whose ambition was
insatiable and whose trade was war. Having been
sent to the castle of Musso on the lake of Como, by
the duke of Milan, with a letter charging the governor
to put the bearer to death, the cunning Giangiacomo
had opened the letter, got together a few companions,
seized the castle, and made a small principality
of it, which he had increased little by little, by furious
inroads into the surrounding districts—the Valteline,
the Milanese, Venetia, and even the Grisons. The
Swiss, with Nägueli at their head, marched against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">{371}</a></span>
the robber chieftain and destroyed his lair. From
that time the daring freebooter had carried his impetuosity
and devastations elsewhere. Portions of
French Switzerland, on the side of the Jura, had been
ravaged by him. It was this Attila on a small scale
whom Charles III. selected to put at the head of the
new campaign against Geneva. It was not a question
of merely taking the city, but of putting it in such a
position that it could never lift its head again; in
short, of destroying it. Giangiacomo was just the man
for the work. At a later period Charles V., wishing
to employ him against the German Reformation,
created him marquis of Marignano, and gave him the
command of the artillery in his campaign against the
Lutherans. For the present, however, it was not
Wittemberg but Geneva that Medici was to lay waste.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_696" id="Ref_696" href="#Foot_696">[696]</a></span></p>

<p>The duke of Savoy placed his general at the head
of an army composed of four thousand Italians,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_697" id="Ref_697" href="#Foot_697">[697]</a></span>
besides
Savoyards and Spaniards, stout, strong fellows,
most of them old soldiers. A considerable number
of armed men were summoned from the valley of the
Leman to join Medici, and thus double or even
triple his forces. The warlike brother of the future
Pope Pius IV., supported by great princes, by the
duke of Savoy and the emperor, had no doubt of
victory. He began his march along the valley of the
Leman.</p>

<p>The peril was great, but was everything lost? Was
there not a power in Geneva which had not been
found in Verceil or Asti? 'There seem to be no
means of escaping from the hands of our enemies,'
said the pious Genevans; 'but our hope is in God,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">{372}</a></span>
who will not suffer His holy name to be blasphemed
by infidels.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_698" id="Ref_698" href="#Foot_698">[698]</a></span></p>

<p>Berne had long closed her ears to the cries of Geneva.
Baudichon de la Maisonneuve had gone thither
to point out the extremity to which his country was
reduced. At the moment when the peril had become
greatest, the Bear awoke, and prepared to descend
from his mountains. Political motives had no doubt
something to do with this decision of the Council.
After the war in Burgundy, the 'pays romand' (the
French-speaking part of Switzerland) had attracted
the attention of that powerful republic. Somewhat
later she had formed treaties of co-citizenship with
Geneva and Lausanne; and when she saw the king of
France raising an army, and moving it towards the
Alps, she feared lest that prince should be beforehand
with her. But the solicitations of Baudichon de la
Maisonneuve, and the voices of the Bernese citizens
who were for independence and the Reformation, had,
after God, the greatest share in the decision of that
state. The Bernese Council issued a proclamation to
the people, in which, after setting forth the peril of
Geneva, they went on to say: 'This matter touches,
first of all, the glory of God, and next it touches us.'
'We are ready,' answered the people, 'to sacrifice
our goods and our lives for the maintenance of the
faith and of our oaths.' Twenty thousand men offered
to march. The change which now took place in the
councils of Berne was so unexpected that it was
generally ascribed to the direction of God. 'Berne,
urged by the divine inspiration, is moving,' wrote a
pious Bernese to Bullinger, Zwingle's successor at
Zurich.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_699" id="Ref_699" href="#Foot_699">[699]</a></span>
 And that excellent Genevan, Porral, said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">{373}</a></span>
in the fulness of his joy: 'O God, I thank Thee for
that Thou hast inspired our citizens to give us help
and comfort.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_700" id="Ref_700" href="#Foot_700">[700]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 16th of January a herald bore to the duke
of Savoy a declaration of war with fire and sword.
Francis Nägueli was unanimously appointed commander
of the expedition. A decided Christian, a
tried captain, and a skilful negotiator, he was adored
by his soldiers, who called him 'our Franz.' From
the twenty thousand men who offered themselves he
selected six thousand. He gave two orders. A new
weapon was then succeeding the halberds and the
long swords; the arquebuses threw balls that struck
the enemy invisibly. Nägueli wished to have the
advantage of that weapon. 'Bring <i>fire-sticks</i>,' he
said. He moreover exacted strict discipline: 'Be
orderly, just, and kind towards the peasantry, as well
as fearless in battle.'</p>

<p class="side">=BERTHOLD HALLER.=</p>

<p>There was another man in Berne who had the cause
of Geneva as much at heart as Nägueli. The reformer,
Berthold Haller, bowed down with suffering,
had only a few days to live. Yet as the army, before
leaving Berne, wished publicly to pray for God's help,
he left his sick-bed with some difficulty, and, supported
by his friends, crawled into the cathedral
pulpit. That man, so mild, so timid, so mistrustful
of himself, showed on the approach of death an energy
which had hitherto been foreign to him. 'Men of
Berne,' he said, with a voice almost inaudible, 'be
firm and courageous. Magistrates and people, officers
and soldiers, remain faithful to the Word of God.
Honor the Gospel, by behaving righteously, and follow
up unshrinkingly for the love of God your intention
to snatch from the destruction that threatens
them our poor brethren of Geneva, hitherto sadly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">{374}</a></span>
forsaken of men.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_701" id="Ref_701" href="#Foot_701">[701]</a></span>
Then lifting his trembling hands
towards heaven, Haller stretched them above the
silent army, and exclaimed, 'May God fill your hearts
with faith, and may He be your Comforter!' The
whole army, the whole people, in the city, in the
canton, and even in the upper valleys among the
perpetual snows, repeated these words—the last the
reformer uttered in public—which became the watchwords
of this holy war.</p>

<p>On Saturday (January 22d) six thousand men left
the city, marching with a firm step, not under their
peculiar flags (for each city had its own), but under that
of Berne alone, a symbol at once of strength and unity.
A hundred cavalry and sixteen pieces of cannon accompanied
the infantry. They all wore a white cross on
a red field; the old mark of the crusaders was their only
uniform. Haller's words had borne fruit. Those
children of the mountains went to the help of their
brothers with enthusiasm and with faith. The noble
Nägueli rode at their head. He desired to make an
evangelical and Helvetic country of the beautiful valley
of the Leman. He was serious and silent, for he was
meditating on the means of freeing Geneva completely,
but at the cost of as little blood as possible. The
soldiers marched after him, active and joyful, in the
midst of a crowd of men, women, and children collected
from the villages round about; and those bold Helvetians,
with heads erect, made the road echo with their songs
of war. The Chronicle of old Switzerland has preserved
them for us:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="side">=THE ARMY AT MORAT.=</p>

<p>On the first day the army reached the battle-field of
Morat, which the soldiers hailed with enthusiasm. The
contingents of Bienne, Nidau, La Neuville, Neuchâtel,
Valengin, Château d'Œx, Gessenay, and Payerne, burning
with affection for Geneva and the Reformation, joined
the Bernese flag in the last-named town. Here the
Avoyer de Watteville passed this noble army in review
on the 24th of January, and administered the oath to it.</p>

<p>Geneva presented at this time a less showy spectacle.
The famine, which for some months had distressed the
city, was now prowling like a ghastly phantom in every
street, frightening the women and children, and even
the men themselves. Cold and sickness, the inevitable
consequences of deprivation, filled the houses with suffering
and mourning. These adversities were like a
fierce torrent that sweeps away everything it touches.
Even the brave began to grow dejected. At this conjuncture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">{376}</a></span>
a man arrived from Berne, the bearer of two
messages. One, on paper, had been given him to avert
suspicion in case he should be stopped by the governor
of Vaud; it was a demand for Furbity's liberation.
The other message was to be made verbally. 'Detain
me here a prisoner,' said the Bernese, 'and put me to
death, if my lords do not march out with their army to
help you.' The people of Geneva could not believe him.
'In three days,' he added, 'you will see the castles of
the country in flames. That will be the signal of
Berne's coming.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_703" id="Ref_703" href="#Foot_703">[703]</a></span></p>

<p>When there was no longer any doubt of the arrival of
the liberators, the Genevan population, so long afflicted,
breathed and took courage. The most energetic men
did not want to wait until their allies had arrived.
Versoix, an important place belonging to the duke of
Savoy, might stop the Bernese army. Fourscore
citizens, manning a few boats, attacked it from the lake,
put to flight the soldiers of Savoy by the fire of their
cannon, and entered the fortress. The granaries were
filled with corn, the cellars with wine, and the stalls
with cattle: this was to the hungry citizens like the
scene in the camp of the Syrians at the gates of
Samaria.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_704" id="Ref_704" href="#Foot_704">[704]</a></span>
The Genevese hastily removed to their
boats all that they could carry away, and returning to
the city displayed their booty in the market-place in the
midst of an immense crowd. Wheat, barley, and cattle
were sold at a low rate. Everybody ran and bought
what he wanted; all rejoiced at this unexpected succor.
And yet great danger still impended over Geneva.</p>

<p class="side">=COMBINATION OF PRINCES.=</p>

<p>It is true Berne was coming to her help; but more
than that was required to save the city. The emperor's
plan was (as we have seen) to crush the Reformation,
which opposed his absolute sovereignty in Germany.
It has been said that Francis I., attracted by the offer of
Milan, had shown an inclination to let Charles V. do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">{377}</a></span>
what he liked. Could Berne resist that powerful
monarch?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_705" id="Ref_705" href="#Foot_705">[705]</a></span>
Would not the patricians, who more than
once had shown themselves very cold with respect to
Geneva, be found returning to their old system of compromises
and delays? A great change in the relations
and projects of the princes could alone, as it would
appear, save the city. Now just at this very moment a
series of events was taking place that suddenly transformed
the political aspect of Europe.</p>

<p>Catherine of Aragon, aunt of Charles V., died. In
consequence of her decease, the emperor relinquished
his design of invading England, and kept the duchy
of Milan, which he had offered to the king of France to
induce him to combine against Henry VIII. Francis I.,
treated by the emperor as a person of no importance,
swore that he would be avenged. But to reach Charles
V. and seize Milan, it was necessary to march over the
body of his uncle, the duke of Savoy. He did not
hesitate to let this prince know 'how little he would be
advantaged by not having France for a friend.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_706" id="Ref_706" href="#Foot_706">[706]</a></span>
Now,
if the duke of Savoy, prince of Piedmont, is driven by
the king of France beyond the Alps and further still,
Geneva is saved.</p>

<p>At the sight of the danger which threatened him,
Charles III. would have liked to renew the old alliance
with his nephew; but the influence of his wife, who
had 'led him into this dance,'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_707" id="Ref_707" href="#Foot_707">[707]</a></span>
kept him bound to the
cause of the emperor. In his embarrassment he formed
a resolution that was not devoid of a certain cleverness,
and which would make the conquest of Geneva and its
annexation to the dominions of the emperor inevitable.
Charles III. offered to cede to Charles V., in exchange
for various Italian provinces, the western slopes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">{378}</a></span>
Alps, 'all the country he possessed from Nice to the
Swiss League, including Geneva.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_708" id="Ref_708" href="#Foot_708">[708]</a></span>
By establishing the
house of Austria between himself and France, the duke
would raise an impassable barrier against his restless
neighbor, and at the same time gratify the taste of the
house of Savoy, which loved to extend itself on the side
of Italy. By virtue of this exchange, the states of
Charles V. would have bordered France everywhere
from the Mediterranean to the North Sea. Francis I.
was alarmed. 'I will not permit the emperor,' he said,
'to set up such a <i>ladder</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_709" id="Ref_709" href="#Foot_709">[709]</a></span>
 against my kingdom, in order
to invade it from that quarter hereafter.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_710" id="Ref_710" href="#Foot_710">[710]</a></span>
All his
hesitation ceased, and he determined to carry out without
delay the plan he had formed of invading Savoy,
Piedmont, and the Milanese. Thus at the very moment
when the duke was preparing to crush Geneva, he saw
a storm suddenly gathering which was at once to drive
him from both slopes of the Alps and save the little
city. Let us see whether such was really the result of
that policy.</p>

<p>The Swiss army, commanded by Nägueli, had
started from Payerne on the 24th of January and
arrived the next day at Echallens, whence it was to
march on Morges. The contingents of Orbe and
Lausanne, desirous of taking part in the deliverance of
Geneva, came to increase his force, which was thus
raised to about ten thousand men. Sebastian de
Montfaulcon, bishop of Lausanne, a proud, intriguing,
domineering priest, inflamed with anger at seeing his
people declare for Geneva, determined to raise troops to
oppose the liberating army. His bailiff and secretary,
going into the steep and narrow streets of the city,
knocked at every door, and asked whether the inmates
would take the side of the bishop or of the burgesses.
Montfaulcon himself set out for his castle of Glérolles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">{379}</a></span>
near St. Saphorin, in order to stir up the inhabitants of
La Vaux. But Nägueli was to encounter in his march a
more formidable obstacle than Montfaulcon and his
extempore soldiers.</p>

<p>Medici, informed of the march of the Bernese army,
had determined to attack it before it reached Geneva.
He could see that if Nägueli were once established in
that city, it would not be easy to take it. The plan
of the Italian commander was to march by Thonon
and Evian, carry his soldiers across the lake, give
battle to the Bernese, and, after defeating them,
turn upon Geneva, which would be incapable of resisting
him. The character and antecedents of the
devastating condottiere were sufficient to indicate the
fate reserved for his conquest. The city would have
been pillaged, perhaps burnt, in conformity with the
habits of Giangiacomo.</p>

<p class="side">=THE TWO ARMIES MEET.=</p>

<p>That formidable chief had crossed the lake with
his army in boats from Chablais, and had almost
reached Morges; his intention being to give a solid
base to his operations, not only by being master of
Morges, which was under the duke's orders, but still
further by taking possession, with the bishop's help,
of Lausanne, whose liberal citizens were ready to
join Nägueli. On the 27th of January, in the evening,
a detachment started for that purpose under the
orders of the Sieur de Colloneys. But the latter had
not gone far when Medici perceived fires on the
heights near the villages of Bussigny, Renens, and
Crissier; it was the Bernese who were preparing to
bivouac on the hills. The fugitive governor of Musso
had no idea that the enemy was so near. He had
not yet taken up his position and the Swiss were in
sight. He called back the detachment, and early
next morning sent out some of his cavalry to reconnoitre
the Swiss army and skirmish with them.
Nägueli, not doubting that the hour of battle had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">{380}</a></span>
arrived, drew up his formidable line on the heights of
Morges; all his men were full of ardor.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_711" id="Ref_711" href="#Foot_711">[711]</a></span>
Medici
also desired to arrange his troops for the struggle,
but was not blind to the disadvantages of his position.
Nägueli was on the heights, while the Savoyard
troops had their backs to the lake, into which they
might be driven. The general, sent by the duke of
Savoy to destroy Geneva, looked with astonishment
at the army of the new crusaders. He found himself
in presence of that valorous Nägueli who, as captain-general
of the Leagues, had taken from him his
castle of Musso and the lands he had seized by
stratagem or force. More than once this robber-chief
had said: 'What neither the emperor nor the king of
France could do, that Switzer did.' And now, at the
head of the troops of Piedmont and Savoy, and
supported by Charles V., the late castellan of Musso
had flattered himself with the hope of taking vengeance
for the injury he had once endured; but it
was the contrary that happened. Instead of rushing
forward at the head of his veteran soldiers, he was
confused; he hesitated, and his heart seemed to
fail him.</p>

<p class="side">=FLIGHT OF MEDICI.=</p>

<p>How was that? Was it because the sight of the
army of Berne in line of battle intimidated him?
Was it because the gentlemen of Vaud and Gex, upon
whom he had counted, remembering the valor of
the Swiss at Gingins, had no desire to risk the chance
of receiving a second lesson, and kept away? Was
it because the reinforcements expected from Savoy
had not arrived? Or was it because bad news reached
him from Chambery, informing him that the duke
could think of nothing but the defence of his hereditary
states against the king of France? All these
reasons had something to do with the trouble of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">{381}</a></span>
former castellan of Musso; but the last was the
strongest. What a vexation for Medici! He had
vaunted that he would put an end to the interminable
existence of Geneva; and at the first
rencounter he has to retreat. He had reckoned on
the pleasure of destroying <i>a nest of heretics</i>, and
he cannot prevent Nägueli's saving it. At this critical
moment, one of the most daring captains of the age
seemed to become one of the most cowardly. There
are people who, audacious in prosperity, lose their
heads when the chances are against them. The flotilla
in which the commander of the troops of Savoy
had traversed the lake lay at anchor a little distance
from Morges, on the side of Lausanne. Medici
deserted the field of battle without striking a blow,
and embarked a portion of his troops while the
remainder stopped in Morges, a fortified city. Nägueli,
seeing that the enemy was retiring, pushed
the advanced guard of the Swiss down to the shore.
The Italian captain, desiring at least to burn a few
cartridges, discharged the guns of his fleet at the
Bernese, who returned the fire; but it was not
difficult for the latter to get out of reach of the
cannonade.</p>

<p>During this petty engagement, the Spaniards and
Italians, who to the number of about seven hundred had
taken shelter in Morges, furious at seeing the triumph
of the protestants so near at hand, behaved in that city,
which belonged to the duke, as if they had been in a
hostile town. They rushed into the castle, broke open
private houses, and even pillaged the churches, everywhere
committing the cruellest outrages;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_712" id="Ref_712" href="#Foot_712">[712]</a></span>
after which
they opened the gate on the Rolle side, and most of them
ran away. Some escaped on horseback, 'and the rest,
says Froment, 'got off fighting with a two-legged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">{382}</a></span>
sword.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_713" id="Ref_713" href="#Foot_713">[713]</a></span>
Medici sent two or three boats to Morges to
bring off those who had not decamped, and then sailed
away to Savoy. One might almost say that an invincible
angel of the Almighty, as in the days of Judah,
had put the enemies of the Word of God to flight.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_714" id="Ref_714" href="#Foot_714">[714]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE POWER OF MORAL FORCE.=</p>

<p>The break-up was complete: a panic terror had fallen
upon the soldiers. The roads, the plain, the mountain
paths were crowded with fugitives. The motives that
induced Medici to retire were doubtless unknown to his
troops; but there is another explanation, a moral explanation,
of their disorderly flight. The Italian bands
had crossed the Alps because their captains had promised
to deliver up to them Geneva, whose wealth
rumor had greatly exaggerated. It was a very different
motive that animated the Swiss: they had left their
mountains and their valleys to secure national independence
and liberty of faith in Geneva in opposition to
the pope, the bishop, and the duke. The Genevese
themselves, in the obstinate struggle they had maintained
for so many years, were impelled by the noblest
motives. But moral principles give to an army a moral
energy which bands of pillagers cannot resist. There
is no doubt that Medici's condottieri were in many respects
better soldiers than the shepherds of the Alps or
the shopkeepers of the little city; but the latter had a
holy cause to defend. Their glance sufficed to scare the
bandits, who, renouncing the plunder of the hostile city,
pillaged the towns of their allies and fled as fast as oars
or legs could carry them. On the 30th of January the
Council of Geneva were able to enter the following
words on their minutes: 'Four thousand Italian and
other foreigners, who had made preparations at Morges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">{383}</a></span>
for the defence of the country (Vaud), made no resistance
and fled like cowards without striking a blow.'</p>

<p>But Nägueli might encounter adversaries more formidable
than the Italians of Medici. The chiefs of all the
district lying between the Alps and the Jura, not only
those of Vaud, but of Gex, Chablais, and other parts of
Savoy, were a real power. It was not known at that
time what part they would take. Their absence from
Morges might only have been occasioned by delay.
Might not the priests be found arousing their parishioners
and marching at their head, as they had done three
months before at the battle of Gingins? If the cavaliers
of the Middle Ages should unite with the mercenaries of
the sixteenth century, it would be all over with Geneva.
But the victory gained at Gingins by four hundred and
fifty sons of the Reformation over three to four thousand
nobles and soldiers, had, as we have mentioned, spread
terror throughout the country. They called to mind
that one had put seven to flight; that many chiefs had
fallen by the balls of those keen marksmen; and that a
hundred priests had bitten the dust. Hence it was that
only a few of the gentry had any idea of taking up the
sword: the priests kept silence, and even the intrepid
baron of La Sarraz went and hid himself within the
walls of Yverdun. The real feat of arms that delivered
Geneva was the victory of Gingins, gained by the
independent friends of the reformation: the official expedition
of Berne was the triumphal march which
gathered the fruits and wore the laurels.</p>

<p>Nägueli, who stopped in Morges until the next day,
was aroused in the middle of the night by his alarmed
followers. The sentries at the harbor had heard the
noise of oars in the distance. Was the enemy returning
from Savoy in greater force? Each man held his breath,
the sound drew nearer, and presently a boat approached.
It might perhaps be followed by others; but no, it was
alone, and brought letters for Medici which had probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">{384}</a></span>
been delayed. Everything was seized, and from the
dispatches the Bernese general learnt that the count of
Challans had dispatched to the Italian commander a
considerable reinforcement of cavalry and infantry.</p>

<p>Nägueli, thinking to come up with this reinforcement
near Geneva, hurried forward to meet them. On the
morning of the 30th of January he started for Rolle; no
obstacle retarded his march; nobles and soldiers 'had
been reduced to dust by terror.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_715" id="Ref_715" href="#Foot_715">[715]</a></span>
The fields were deserted;
the small towns and villages were empty; fear
of the Bernese had swept the country. The general, in
concert with his chiefs, had agreed that it would be an
unwise policy to neglect establishing peace in that district
with a firm hand, as well for the present as for the future.
Another principle also animated the Bernese: they
wanted to extend the territory of the Helvetic League
and their own as far as the shores of Lake Leman. Now
so long as the power of the nobles of Vaud, who were
strongly attached to Savoy, remained unbroken, there
would be perpetual insurrections, and Berne would
hardly be in a position to hold her own. Nägueli was
persuaded that the strength of the cruel chevaliers of
those valleys lay in their strongholds. 'If we want to
drive out the wolves,' he said, 'we must destroy their
dens.' The castles of Rolle and Rosay were reduced to
ashes; and the Genevans, seeing in the darkness of the
night those distant flames, shouted with joy, '<i>They are
coming!</i>'</p>

<p>Nägueli resumed his march, sparing the inhabitants,
but everywhere destroying the images. Passing near
Nyon without attacking it, he moved upon Divonne and
Gex, important positions from which he desired to
expel the enemy before entering Geneva.</p>

<p class="side">=FRANCOIS DE GINGINS.=</p>

<p>François de Gingins, lord of Divonne and Chatelard,
who had at first taken part in the blockade of Geneva,
but had withdrawn his troops during the frosts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">{385}</a></span>
December, had shut himself up in his castle of Divonne
on the hills which overlook that village. Nägueli
desired to treat with respect a nobleman whose ancestors
had been counted from the tenth century among
the great vassals of the kings of Transjurassic Burgundy,
and who possessed an amiable character and
pacific disposition. Brought up by his maternal uncle,
the count of Gruyères, and afterwards appointed by the
king of France page of honor in his household, he had
returned to his home and married his cousin Margaret,
daughter of Antoine de Gingins, president of the sovereign
council of Savoy. He had small liking for the
priests, whose gross and often immoral conduct offended
him; but he was alarmed at the idea of being unfaithful
to the Church and feudalism, and after some hesitation
attached himself to Roman-catholicism and the duke.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_716" id="Ref_716" href="#Foot_716">[716]</a></span>
Margaret had, it is said, some share in the change
which afterwards occurred in the family. The ladies of
the castles were generally superior to their husbands;
they were more accessible to religious impressions.
While the lord was away at tournaments or on warlike
expeditions, the wife remained mistress of the household,
governed her children and servants, and virtues
were often developed in her which would have been
vainly sought for elsewhere. A son speaking of his
mother, describes her beauty, her features always
tranquil, her brow armed with severe chastity, her
virtuous looks, her regulated conversation, her modesty,
her fear of God, and her charity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_717" id="Ref_717" href="#Foot_717">[717]</a></span>
It is thus we love to
picture to ourselves Margaret of Gingins.</p>

<p>The young lord of Divonne liked the neighborhood
of Geneva and the intelligence of its inhabitants, and,
without being aware of it, the cause of the Reformation
had made some progress in his heart. In 1548 he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">{386}</a></span>
made over his four castles of Gingins, Divonne,
Chatelard, and Sarraz to his sons, and retired to
Geneva, where he remained to the end of his days.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_718" id="Ref_718" href="#Foot_718">[718]</a></span>
Thus, in his person, peace was concluded between the
redoubtable gentlemen of the country and the city
which they had so harassed. Nägueli, aware of the
good inclinations of the baron, did not burn his castle,
and was content with exacting from him a ransom of
three hundred crowns.</p>

<p>On Tuesday (February 1st) ten syndics of Geneva
came to present the Bernese general with the thanks of
the city. While they were in conference with him, a
noise was heard in the castle. They all pricked up their
ears. The old abbot De Gingins, episcopal vicar of
Geneva, who had retired (as we have seen) into the
Jura, to his isolated convent of Bonmont, alarmed at
the approach of the army, disturbed by the recollection
of his licentious life, and remembering that the Swiss
had no liking for wicked priests, a great number of
whom had fallen at Gingins, had taken refuge at Divonne
in his nephew's castle, where he believed himself safe
from all harm. He kept quiet in a secret hiding-place,
greatly tormented by fear that the Bernese might discover
him. Some soldiers, who were ordered to search
the castle, found him and brought him more dead than
alive before their general. As the latter sharply reproached
the lord of Divonne with violating their convention,
the alarm of the old sinner increased; but he
began to breathe again, when the general declared that
he would be willing to release him for a ransom of
four hundred crowns. The poor abbot, though the fear
of death was passed, never recovered from his fright.</p>

<p>The Savoyard troops, whose arrival had been
announced to Medici by the count of Challans, had not
appeared, and we may understand the reason. Consequently,
next morning (February 2d) Nägueli, finding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">{387}</a></span>
that there was no enemy to prevent his entering Geneva,
divided his soldiers into three corps: one was to reduce
the country between the Rhone and the Jura as far as
the Fort de l'Ecluse, which it was to take; the other
was to march to Gex, and burn the castle; while the
rest of the army started for Geneva.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_719" id="Ref_719" href="#Foot_719">[719]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=BERNESE WAR-SONG.=</p>

<p>The Genevans awaited with great impatience the arrival
of their liberators. The sun cheered with its beams
the brightest of the days in Genevese history. The
snows which covered the mountains glittered in the
distance; but in the plain at their feet, flashes of light
were observed which delighted the citizens still more.
'Two leagues off,' says Froment, 'we could see the arms
glittering, which was a great joy to us.' The young
people ran forward to meet their deliverers, and in a
short time the Bernese army approached and passed
through an enthusiastic crowd stationed on both sides
of the road. The leaders Nägueli, Weingarten, Cyro,
Diesbach, and Graffenried, came first on horseback;
then followed the bannerets, councillors, provosts, and
other members of the Councils of Berne; and last of all
the liberating army, seventeen pieces of artillery, and
the companies of Neuchâtel, Lausanne, and other places
in Vaud. As the Bernese passed the gates and entered
the city, they sang aloud once more these strains to the
glory of God:</p>

<p>'Geneva received her deliverers with great delight,'
says an eye-witness, 'and replied to their songs with
cries of joy.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_722" id="Ref_722" href="#Foot_722">[722]</a></span>
The barbarous captain, sent against the
huguenots to destroy them, had disappeared; the wild
beast, after a roar, had returned hastily to his den.
Their goods, their liberty, their faith, their lives were
saved. Excited by this great deliverance, the Genevans
were not satisfied merely with expressing their gratitude
to the Bernese, but looked higher. They knew that a
Supreme Power, an Infinite Love, holds the affairs of
this world in His hands. It was that faith which was
to make the little city grow, and they wished to give
expression to it. The council being assembled, they
resolved to enrol in the annals of the republic a testimony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">{390}</a></span>
of their gratitude, and ordered these words to
be written:</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">DESTRUCTION OF THE CASTLES—JOY IN GENEVA—LIBERATION OF BONIVARD.<br />
 (<span class="smc">From February to the end of March 1536.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">There</span> was now to be an interview between the
liberators and the liberated. Berne and Geneva,
united by a common faith, were to embrace each
other. The members of those two republics loved
one another not only as allies but as brothers. On
Thursday (February 3d) the Council of Two Hundred
assembled; many other citizens were present, and
the hall was full. Nägueli appeared, accompanied by
his principal officers and the representatives of the
Council of Berne. The assembly gave utterance to
its joy, and all eyes were fixed on the valiant general.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">{391}</a></span>
'Most honored lords,' he said, 'this long while past
we have heard your complaints. For these twenty
months we have been making great efforts at Lucerne,
Baden, and even Aosta; and having thus exhausted
all the means of peace, we have drawn the sword, and
the enemy has fled on every side. Now we will do
whatever you command us, for we are here to fulfil
the oaths that unite Geneva and Berne.' Such noble
language moved the assembly. 'May God do the
same for you,' replied the premier syndic. Then
desiring the work to be perfect, he added: 'Now,
gentlemen, march onwards; pursue the enemy until
the end; we are ready to give you all necessary
assistance.' It was decided that the army should
make itself master of Chablais on the left shore of
the lake, and push forward on the other side as far as
Chambery. In all those districts they would circulate
the Word of God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_725" id="Ref_725" href="#Foot_725">[725]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=BURNING OF THE CASTLES.=</p>

<p>There was first another task to be completed. For
centuries the castles had obstructed the progress of
civilization, and in later years that of the gospel. It was
from those eyries, perched on their lofty rocks, that the
vultures swooped down upon the plain. Bishops even
had been known to entreat the princes to destroy, 'for
the love of God and the honor of the blessed Mary, those
buildings constructed by the inspiration of Satan.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_726" id="Ref_726" href="#Foot_726">[726]</a></span>
This
the evangelical Nägueli was about to do, and henceforth
the husbandman would drive his plow in peace through
fields from which he would no longer fear to see the
fruit of his labors swept away.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the castles had disappeared: fear
of the Bernese had depopulated the country. Men,
women, and children had taken refuge in the miserable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">{392}</a></span>
chalets of the Salève, Voirons, Mole, and Jura. Priests
and monks, hurriedly abandoning their parishes and
their convents, threw off their frocks and assumed the
garb of the peasantry. 'Not one man in all the country
dared represent himself as a priest or a monk.' Every
now and then one of them dressed in a coarse gray coat
would leave his hiding-place, and mysteriously entering
some half-deserted hut, would ask the affrighted peasant
'what the bear of Berne was doing.' 'But take care,' he
added, 'you tell nobody that I am a priest.' The clerical
and lay despots of the Middle Ages learnt in their turn
what it was to tremble.</p>

<p>At length a great spectacle of desolation, which was to
be the last, began. A judgment—may we not call it a
judgment of God?—was accomplished. Here and there
at first a few flames were seen flashing forth, and these
soon became an immense conflagration. Detachments,
consisting of Bernese and Genevans, issued from the city:
some turned to the right, others to the left; the ancient
walls of some old towers were their aim. 'It was from
thence,' said the Genevans, 'that rapine and death have
so often rushed out upon us.' The building was surrounded,
the most impetuous made their way into the interior
and set fire to it, and when the flames had caught
they rushed off for another execution. These detachments
were followed by a numerous troop of men, women,
and boys, who had their share also in the business. The
judgment of God swept over the country, as of old over
the land of Canaan. The fortresses of Gex, Gaillard,
and Jussy, those terrible scourges of Geneva; the castles
of Coppet, Prangins, Bellerive, Vilette, Ville-la-Grand,
and many others, fell a prey to the flames. They were
in all, according to Froment, from a hundred to a
hundred and forty. Geneva was sometimes surrounded
by a circle of fire. The longer and crueller the offence,
the more terrible was the punishment. No one was put
to death, but those feudal lairs, which crumbled away in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">{393}</a></span>
the midst of the flames, were a sacrifice offered by the
Swiss to the shades of the citizens immolated by their
former possessors.</p>

<p class="side">=DESTRUCTION OF PENEY.=</p>

<p>There was one castle in particular whose destruction
the Genevans desired: it was Peney. On the 8th of
February some Bernese, accompanied by a few horsemen
and gunners of Geneva, started for this purpose.
The blood shed by the Peneysans and their numberless
outrages made them cry out unanimously, 'No mercy
for Peney!' The almost abandoned fortress was easily
occupied. A fire was kindled in that courtyard where
the victims had been so cruelly tortured. The castle
was soon in flames, and there remained nothing but
dismantled towers and blackened walls; but that was
not enough. Those walls still seemed guilty, and the
Genevans so completely destroyed the ill-omened ruin
that not a trace of it can now be found. All the country
was at length swept clean of a long-continued brigandage;
but (we repeat) it does not appear that one of
those gentlemen or of their dependents suffered death
or even imprisonment for their crimes. The device of
Geneva and of Berne during this remarkable expedition
was: 'Spare the tyrants, but destroy their dens.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_727" id="Ref_727" href="#Foot_727">[727]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time peace reigned within. A spirit of
pardon seemed to have descended upon the Genevans.
Happiness enlarged all their hearts. On Sunday (February
6th) sermons were preached in the different
churches by the reformers; after which the great bell,
Clémence, reserved for solemn occasions, summoned all
the people to St. Pierre's. It was, as it were, the first
day of the new republic. 'Citizens,' said one of the
syndics, 'in order that the city may prosper we must
believe what the Gospel teaches and live according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">{394}</a></span>
its commandments. Accordingly—and this is our new
decree—let all the animosities which sprang up during
the war be renounced; all offences pardoned, all quarrels
forgotten, all lawsuits given up. Let us drop all
hateful names. Let no man henceforth say to another,
"You are a papist," or the latter reply, "You are a
Lutheran." But let us all live according to the Holy
Gospel of God,' Such were the first fruits of the
Reformation. 'We will! we will!' shouted the people.
They then proceeded to the election of the four syndics
who were to be at the head of the new republic. The
assembly chose the energetic Claude Savoye, the amiable
and persevering Ami Porral, and the zealous Etienne
de Chapeaurouge, men on the side of the Reformation
but especially of political experience. The people,
wishing to have among their magistrates one man purely
evangelical, named Ami Levet, the husband of the pious
Claudine, although he was not on the list proposed by
the senate. Shortly afterwards the Two Hundred
elected the twenty-five members of the Council, and
Balard, as well as Richardet, Roman-catholics but good
citizens, preserved their seats. In the hour of their
greatest enthusiasm the Genevans behaved justly and
without party-spirit—a thing rarely witnessed in the
annals of nations.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_728" id="Ref_728" href="#Foot_728">[728]</a></span></p>

<p>On the evening before, Nägueli, at the head of the
army, augmented by a Genevese contingent, had
marched out in order to follow up his victory as far
as Chambery and <i>farther</i>. Ambitious thoughts may
then perhaps have stirred the hearts of some of the
Bernese. For the triumph of the Reformation (they
might possibly have said for the grandeur of Berne)
they thought that Savoy, and even the north of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">{395}</a></span>
Italy, ought to be conquered. Let there be formed
in the centre of Europe, on both sides of the colossal
citadels of the Alps, a great confederation of independent
and evangelical people, which shall circulate
liberty and truth through Germany, France, and the
Italian peninsula. Therefore forward to Chambery,
and <i>farther</i>!</p>

<p>The dream was to melt away as soon as formed.
The general was riding in front, calm and pensive,
followed by some of his officers. He turned his head—there
was no army to be seen. Nägueli galloped
back towards Geneva, and found his soldiers drawn
up in a square in a large field and deliberating democratically.
What was the cause of such a breach of
military discipline? The soldiers, satisfied with
having delivered Geneva, did not care to follow their
captain in his daring schemes. They deliberated
therefore, as they were wont to do in their valleys.
Should they march forward or turn back? 'To Berne,'
cried many; 'to our fields, our flocks, our mountains!'
Nägueli succeeded, however, in getting the army to
march. Was he not their <i>good Franz</i>?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_729" id="Ref_729" href="#Foot_729">[729]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE FRENCH INVADE SAVOY.=</p>

<p>On Saturday, 12th of February, the Swiss advanced
guard had reached Rumilly, near the lake of Bourget,
eight leagues from Chambery, when M. de Villebon,
grand provost of Paris, arrived in great haste at
the camp. 'The king my master,' he said, 'has a
quarrel with the duke of Savoy, his uncle, about his
mother's rights. Yesterday (February 11th) he signed
at Lyons the commission given to the Sire de Brion-Chabot,
admiral of France, to attack Savoy. Eight
hundred French lances, a thousand light horse, twelve
thousand infantry, six thousand lansquenets, two
thousand French adventurers, three thousand Italians,
and a powerful artillery are about to enter the states
of the duchy; and when Savoy is conquered, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">{396}</a></span>
French army will invade Piedmont. I require you,
therefore, in the name of the king, to proceed no
farther.' Nägueli, already shaken by the demands of
his soldiers, answered that as the King of France had
rights over those countries, the Swiss would discontinue
their advance.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_730" id="Ref_730" href="#Foot_730">[730]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=LAST YEARS OF THE DUKE.=</p>

<p>Other hands than those of Switzerland were to deal
the last blows destined to secure the Reformation and
independence of Geneva. Villebon had hardly got
back to Lyons, when the army of Francis I. moved
forward, overran Bresse and Savoy, then invaded
Piedmont, and afterwards the Milanese. The duke,
always irresolute, had taken no steps to check the
French. It was in vain that at the last moment he
called Medici to his aid; that captain, who had been
unable to destroy Geneva, could not save Piedmont.
Charles III., abandoned by the emperor, his brother-in-law,
found himself, after spending thirty years of
his life in hunting down Geneva, robbed in four months
of his states, which he never entered again, and driven
to bay on the shores of the Mediterranean. All
kinds of disasters fell upon him at once. His country
was devastated by the plague; his friends turned
against him; the emperor showed him no pity; his son,
the heir to his crown, was taken away by death; his
beautiful and haughty wife, Beatrice of Portugal,
pierced to the heart by so many misfortunes, died of
a wasting sickness. Of all his states there was
nothing left but the valley of Aosta, Nice, and two
or three other cities. Alone and affrighted, this
unhappy prince dragged out a wearisome life. He
regretted his son, regretted his wife, regretted his
states. His heated imagination surrounded him with
phantoms; Geneva, which, unopposed, was developing
her glorious and new existence, was to him an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">{397}</a></span>
avenging ghost. He fell ill: he broke out in sweats;
he shivered with cold; his eyes grew dim and his
face pale; he wasted away of a slow fever. After a
punishment of twenty-three years, death, the consequence
of his reverses and his sorrows, put an end to
the painful existence of the great enemy of Genevese
independence and of the Reformation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_731" id="Ref_731" href="#Foot_731">[731]</a></span>
His son, Emanuel
Philibert, a man of great capacity, recovered his
states; but having many evils to repair, he adopted
a pacific policy with regard to Geneva. Forty-four
years of peace permitted the Reformation and the
new republic to strengthen and organize themselves.
God gives to the people and the churches, whom he
designs to make use of, the time necessary for their
development.</p>

<p>While these things were going on, dangers less apparent,
but as great as they were unexpected, threatened
Geneva. As the Bernese desired to reap advantage
from the help accorded to the little republic, their
ambassadors put forward certain pretensions, which
they set up a little later with respect to Lausanne and
Vaud, and which were then too easily conceded. The
lords of Berne, regardless of the reproach that might be
urged against them of having consulted merely their own
interests in the expedition, hinted to the council of Geneva
that they ought to have their reward, and asked that
the rights and prerogatives of the duke and the bishop
should be transferred to them. Such a demand revolted
the proud independence of the Genevese, and they
rejected the sovereignty of Berne with as much decision
as they had rejected that of Savoy. 'If we had desired
to have a master,' they answered with firmness, 'we
should have spared ourselves all the trouble, expense,
and bloodshed of which we have been so prodigal to
secure our independence.' Berne was forced to give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">{398}</a></span>
way before a resolution that appeared immovable.
When Nägueli re-entered Geneva, after having taken the
Fort de l'Ecluse on returning from his short campaign,
he was surprised to meet with a cold and embarrassed
reception, very different from the former enthusiastic
welcome. The noble general, who did not like such
discussions, gave immediate orders for the departure of
his army.</p>

<p>There was still a great work to be accomplished. In
conformity with the instructions of the Bernese government,
Nägueli was to break the twofold yoke of the pope
and the duke which pressed heavily upon the territory
of Vaud. His troops marched into that country without
resistance, and took Yverdun, in which the intrepid
Mangerot had fortified himself. In a short time cities,
villages, and castles submitted; a few towns, tired of
the Savoyard rule, desired to be annexed to Berne.
Others, especially Lausanne and some rural districts,
wished to retain all their rights; but they gave way,
when the Bernese promised to respect their franchises.
Under any circumstances it was a good work to take
away from the pope and unite to Switzerland the beautiful
country that extends from the lake of Geneva to
that of Neuchâtel. Nägueli re-entered Berne in peace,
and his soldiers, proud of a four weeks' campaign that
was to have such important consequences, gave vent to
their exultation, and concluded their songs with this
line:</p>

<p class="center small">Respecte l'ours, ou bien crains les oursons.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_732" id="Ref_732" href="#Foot_732">[732]</a></span></p>

<p>The work appeared to be accomplished. The city of
the Reformation thrilled with joy, and exulted in the
air of liberty and of the Gospel. Here and there,
however, sorrows and regrets remained. Many hearts
were wrung, and many an eye was turned with mortification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">{399}</a></span>
in the direction of Chillon, where Bonivard had
been languishing for six years. He had done so much
to give liberty to Geneva, and he alone was not free.
He was pining away, imprisoned within those rocks,
which, excavated below the level of the lake, form a
gigantic sepulchre. A loophole permitted a feeble ray
of light to enter the dungeon, and the prisoner, while
walking slowly round the column to which he was
chained, delighted to turn his eyes towards that side,
and sometimes contemplated (according to tradition) a
little bird, which used to perch on the iron bars of the
narrow opening. At the slightest noise, the bird flew
off to the wood behind the castle, or skimmed away
over the surface of the lake. The bird was free; but
Bonivard was in chains. 'I had such leisure for walking,'
he said, 'that I wore away a path in the rock, as if
it had been done with a hammer.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_733" id="Ref_733" href="#Foot_733">[733]</a></span>
When he was
seized by the perfidious hands of his enemies he had
said: 'I am going alone, with God, to suffer my
passion!' And suffer it he did. But while his body
and heart suffered, his mind was at work. Some of the
thoughts which then occupied him have been recorded
by his own hand: <i>Live in remembrance of death</i>,—<i>Courage
increases by wounds</i>, and such like. For five or
six months the Genevan envoys, so traitorously seized
at Coppet, had also been imprisoned at Chillon, but not
in the underground dungeons.</p>

<p class="side">=CHILLON ATTACKED.=</p>

<p>Such iniquities could not be tolerated. Berne again
took up her <i>fire-sticks</i>, and Geneva prepared her boats.
On the 20th of March one hundred armed men were
embarked on four war cutters and other vessels. The
Genevese councils had given the command to Francis
Favre and Francis Chamois. All the citizens would
have liked to march in person to Chillon to set Bonivard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">{400}</a></span>
and the plenipotentiaries at liberty. On the day of
sailing, everybody left their houses, and from an agitated
crowd assembled near the Rhone, there rose a universal
cry, 'Rescue the captives!'</p>

<p>On Sunday morning—it was the 26th of March—Bonivard
being as usual in his dungeon, pricked up his
ears. He fancied he heard an unaccustomed noise; he
was not mistaken. Loud but still distant cannon shots
re-echoed through the vaults of his prison. What was
going on? It was the artillery of Berne which, on its
arrival at Lutry, between Lausanne and Chillon,
announced its presence. But that signal of deliverance
was to be the signal of death to Bonivard and the three
envoys. 'If the Bernese appear before the place,'
wrote the duke of Savoy to the governor, 'you will give
the prisoners of Geneva the estrapade twice, and then
put them to death without hesitation.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_734" id="Ref_734" href="#Foot_734">[734]</a></span>
The duke
intended that the deliverers should find nothing but
corpses.</p>

<p>The next morning (27th of March) Chillon was surrounded.
Berne had drawn up her troops and planted
her guns below the village of Veytaux, between the
castle and Montreux. The Valaisans, although catholics,
had also taken up arms to expel the duke from their
neighborhood, and had placed their artillery on the
Villeneuve side; the Genevans blockaded the castle
from the lake. The batteries opened fire, and the
governor perceiving that all resistance was useless,
demanded a parley at nightfall. Nägueli, Favre, and
some other captains assembled at the foot of a steep
rock between the castle and the Bernese batteries, to
receive his deputies; but as they could not come at
once to terms, the conference was prolonged. The
garrison, by no means anxious to fall into the hands

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">{401}</a></span>
momentary respite and of the veil of night, to make
their escape. Silently they crept on board the great
galley; not a voice, not a sound of arms was heard,
and having thus mysteriously got away, they made
rapidly towards Savoy. When Favre was informed of
it, he went immediately on board his boat, which was
moored to the shore, and hastened in pursuit of the
enemy; but before he could get up with them, they had
thrown their cannons into the lake, set fire to the
galley, and from Lugrin, where they landed, hurried
into the Savoyard Alps below the Dents d'Oche.
Had they taken Bonivard and the three plenipotentiaries
with them? It was a question that could not
be answered, and Favre, ill at ease, veered round and
returned to Chillon.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_735" id="Ref_735" href="#Foot_735">[735]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=BONIVARD LIBERATED.=</p>

<p>The governor had surrendered just as he arrived.
Nägueli, on leaving Berne, had written to him that he
should answer with his head for the lives of the prisoners:
he had, therefore, some hope of recovering them.
Favre, Chamois, and the other Genevans hastily sprang
from their boats, entered the castle, and in a minute
they embraced the three envoys. But where was Bonivard?
They seized the keys of the vaults, unlocked a
sunk door, and entered. It was the hall of execution:
beneath its rude arches were wheels, axes, pulleys, cords,
and all the horrible instruments with which men were
crippled or killed. The Genevans, without stopping,
ran to the door of an inner vault, undid the bars,
pulled back the bolts. The friends of the prior of
Saint Victor sprang over the threshold, rushed into the
gloomy dungeon, reached the column. 'Here he is!
he is alive!' Bonivard fell into their arms. His friends
found it difficult to recognize him. The features
changed by suffering, the long unkempt beard, the hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">{402}</a></span>
falling over his shoulders—had changed his appearance.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_736" id="Ref_736" href="#Foot_736">[736]</a></span>
'Bonivard,' they said to him, 'Bonivard, you are free!'
The prisoner, who seemed to be waking from a long
sleep, did not think of himself: his first words were for
the city he had loved so much. 'And Geneva?' he
asked. 'Geneva is free too,' they replied. His chains
were taken off, and, conducted by his friends, he
crossed the door of that vast prison. The bright light
which burst upon him affected his eyes which had
been deprived of it for so many years, and he turned
them mechanically towards the gloom of his dungeon.
At last he recovered himself and bade farewell to his
sepulchre. The crowd looked at him for some moments
with emotion, and then rushed into that dismal cell,
where the wretched man had suffered so long. Every
one desired to see it, and for ages yet to come the
traveller will visit it. The illustrious prisoner was
delivered; the last fortress of tyranny was captured;
the victory of the Reformation was complete. No
traveller wandering along the picturesque shore of
Montreux can fail to look at those walls, rising out of
the water, without a feeling of horror for despotism and
of gratitude for the Gospel. Those rocks, so long the
witnesses of oppression, are now hailed with emotion
and joy by the friends of the Word of God and liberty.</p>

<p>The flotilla was soon sailing back to Geneva with

 <h3>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">THE PEOPLE OF GENEVA DESIRE TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE GOSPEL.<br />
 (<span class="smc">March to June 1536.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">An</span> entire people is not converted to God in a body.
The pagan religions were identical with the nation; but
the Christian Church is distinct from it. Even the
Apostolic Church soon extended beyond the narrow
limits of the tribe of Judah; it was founded at Jerusalem
irrespective of temple, sanhedrim, and Jews, and
subsequently was established among all nations unconnected
with the state. A prince cannot decree a religion
by a cabinet minute; a people cannot elect it
by a majority of votes. There is, however, something
grand in seeing an assembled nation declare without
constraint that they will take the Gospel as the rule
of their faith and the source of their life. This is what
Geneva was about to do.</p>

<p class="side">=EVANGELIZATION BY ORDER.=</p>

<p>The communities which extended from the foot of
the Jura to the Alps of the Voirons and the Mole, had
recognized the councils of Geneva as their legitimate
lords, reserving their own customs and franchises.
But, in the opinion of the Reformers, this territory
would only be an embarrassment, unless a new life were
communicated to its inhabitants and spread over the
whole nation. Commerce, manufactures, liberty, and
letters do much for the prosperity of a people, but cannot
be their life. If the Word of God, <i>if the light of the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">{404}</a></span>
<i>world</i>, does not enlighten them, they fall sooner or later.
These opinions were sufficiently common in Geneva for
an unknown poet to say to the united parishes in this
unpolished strain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Vaut-il pas mieux dire à Dieu nos secrets,</div>

     class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_739" id="Ref_739" href="#Foot_739">[739]</a></span></div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">'Messieurs,' said Farel to the council on the 13th of
March, 'the Word of God ought to be preached in
the parishes subject to this city.' Ten days later he
made a fresh application to that assembly on the same
matter, when he was supported by politicians as well as
by men of piety. To leave the seeds of popery in
Geneva and in her rural dependencies was (they
thought) exposing the state to great danger. In order
to thread the shoals and brave the storms which threatened
the frail bark, there must be a cordial understanding
between all the crew. Several persons exclaimed
with rather an excess of energy: 'If some go to sermon
and others to mass, the republic will go to the devil.'</p>

<p>The work was begun at once. The reformers preached
in Geneva; other ministers preached in the country;
heralds of the council went from village to village
making proclamations by sound of trumpet: 'Let there
be no more disobedience!' they said; 'no more gambling!
No more blasphemy!' Still the council did not
wish to exercise any constraint with regard to religion.
The inhabitants of Viuz and other villages in the
<i>mandement</i> of Thiez in Faucigny having prayed that
they might be allowed their own way as to church
matters, their request was granted. But the bishop,
who was less tolerant, excommunicated the poor people,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">{405}</a></span>
because, although catholics, they recognized heretical
magistrates. The syndics undismayed and very positive
as to their episcopal capacity, wrote to the vicars that
they would relieve their parishes from the excommunication
and completely absolve them—which greatly
comforted the worthy peasants. When Easter drew
near, however, they began to feel great distress.
'Alas!' they said to the syndics, 'as we have been
excommunicated, we cannot take the sacrament at
Easter.' 'We hold you to be entirely absolved,' answered
the reformed magistrates demurely. Upon which
the simple people received the sacrament with great
tranquillity of mind.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_740" id="Ref_740" href="#Foot_740">[740]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE STATE AND THE CHURCH.=</p>

<p>These are strange actions. It has been maintained
that the church, in proportion as political society becomes
Christian, ought gradually to be lost in the state.
It has been asserted that, at the epoch of the Reformation,
Christianity had completed its ecclesiastical period,
and had entered into the political period. Lastly, some
men have added that to organize the church was a useless
labor, a sheer loss of time, an absolute impossibility,
and that presbyteries and synods were but silly child's
play.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_741" id="Ref_741" href="#Foot_741">[741]</a></span>
Was the fact that we have recorded—episcopal
absolution emanating from the council—the first step in
this absorption of the church by the state; and is it true
that the Reformation leads to it? Quite the contrary.
By reviving in the Christian conscience the idea of the
kingdom of God; by awakening to life and action the
members of the evangelical congregation, protestantism
awoke the church throughout Christendom. Geneva,
owing to the impulse given it by Calvin, became the
place where it was constituted in the most independent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">{406}</a></span>
and most scriptural manner. The church must not be
lost in the state, and the state must not be lost in the
church, whatever socialists or priests may say. How can
the state survive the church? The state is temporary, the
church immortal.</p>

<p>But the magistrates heroically discharged their
episcopal functions to little purpose; there was great
difficulty in maintaining order. The villages of Vandœuvre
and Celigny wished to hear mass and a protestant
sermon every Sunday, while the priests universally
demanded the preservation of the Romish ceremonies.
The council felt the necessity of explaining the posture
of affairs, and called together all the ecclesiastics and
proctors of the parishes.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_742" id="Ref_742" href="#Foot_742">[742]</a></span>
On the 3d of April, 1536,
the Romanist party was drawn up on one side of the
council-room, and on the other were Farel, with some
other ministers, and several zealous protestants.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_743" id="Ref_743" href="#Foot_743">[743]</a></span>
Claude Savoye, the premier syndic, spoke against the
union of sermons and the mass, which some parishes
desired, and declared that such a medley was by no means
agreeable to the magistracy. He then said to the
priests: 'Instead of preventing the people from living
according to the Gospel, why do you not embrace it
yourselves, and give up your mass?' Dom Claude de
Puthex, canon of Satigny, stepped forward and said:
'If our neighbors of Gex change their mode of life, we
will do the same.' This religion of <i>neighborhood</i> was a
surprise to the reformers; and those simple folks reminded
them of sheep who pass where others have gone
before, and leap over the hedge as soon as the foremost
of them have shown the way. 'Turn about, gentlemen,'
said Farel, 'instead of continuing your course;' and he
added several 'beautiful remonstrances.' 'Give us a
month to study the Gospel,' answered the canons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">{407}</a></span>
After the priests had withdrawn, the council asked the
opinion of Farel and Bonivard. The latter declared
that 'consciences must be enlightened and not forced.'
Farel also was of opinion that the papists ought not to be
troubled in their devotions, in order that they might not
be exasperated against the Word; but that they ought to
be brought to the Gospel 'with extreme gentleness.'
He therefore proposed that 'the priests during the required
month should give themselves up exclusively to
the inquiry after truth.' When the ecclesiastics were
called in, the syndic informed them that their request
had been granted unanimously; and at the end of the
month, they all declared that they could not prove by the
Gospel either the mass, auricular confession, or other
papal ordinances. The brother of Guy Furbity, who
was in the assembly, declared that Farel's exhortation to
the priests was 'sound according to Holy Scripture and
to God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_744" id="Ref_744" href="#Foot_744">[744]</a></span>
It is true that this person had a reason for
wishing to please the Genevans.</p>

<p class="side">=GUY FURBITY.=</p>

<p>There remained, however, one thing to be done.
They had liberated the protestant Bonivard, they determined
also to set free the Roman-catholic Furbity,
whose release was demanded by his brother William.
Guy left his prison on the 6th of April. He had been
condemned (it will be remembered) to prove his doctrines,
or to retract his insulting language; whereupon
he had asked for books, and the council sent him a
Bible. 'A Bible!' he exclaimed, 'they must be laughing
at me. How can I prove my doctrines with the
help of a Bible? I should not succeed in a twelve-month.'
He wanted the <i>Sentences</i> of Peter Lombard,
the <i>Summa</i> of Thomas Aquinas, and so forth, and they
gave him a Bible! 'Magnificent lords,' he said on the
6th of April, 'I beg your pardon; I said things that
displeased you; I was wrong. I did not know how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">{408}</a></span>
matters were. Henceforward I will endeavor to lead
a better life, and to preach the truth better than I have
hitherto done.' The council ordered him to be set at
liberty forthwith.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_745" id="Ref_745" href="#Foot_745">[745]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=SEVERITY OF FAREL.=</p>

<p>Farel was more active than ever. He was busy in
the city and in the villages with Roman-catholics and
reformed: he was intent on everything that could elevate
the moral and religious condition of the community.
The anarchy and corruption that prevailed in Geneva
upon Calvin's arrival have been exaggerated. The
energetic language of the sixteenth century, interpreted
by the delicate critics of our times, has perhaps contributed
to this mistake. Before the Reformation there
was beyond all doubt great corruption among the
clergy, and particularly among the monks. That dissoluteness
had also infected individuals and even
families among the citizens; but one feature had distinguished
this people, and especially the councils,
during the struggles for political emancipation, namely,
the close union of liberty with legality, that is to say,
with order. The Genevese were always found ready
for the greatest sacrifices—for the sacrifice of their
goods, their ease, their homes, and their lives sooner
than lose their independence: now these are not the
manners of an epicurean people. Admiration of the
Reformation period ought not to make us unjust
towards the period of political emancipation. It is true
that the reformers, and Calvin especially, had a hard
task with this energetic and restless people, and that
the struggles often proceeded from a want of faith
and morality, which these austere men had remarked
in certain citizens. But the struggles were aggravated
by the intervention of the state, to which the ministers
were not averse, and by the temporal punishments
inflicted on those who infringed religious discipline.
Perhaps no one in the sixteenth century perceived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">{409}</a></span>
more clearly than Calvin the distinction between the
spiritual and the temporal; and yet neither he nor Farel
understood it, and above all did not realize it, to its
full extent. 'If there should be men so insolent and
given up to all perversity,' said Farel to the syndics,
'as only to laugh at being excommunicated, it will
be your business to see whether you will allow such
contempt to remain unpunished.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_746" id="Ref_746" href="#Foot_746">[746]</a></span>
The haughty republicans
who had sacrificed everything to break down
the despotism of the bishop and the duke, were irritated
when they saw another yoke imposed upon them
in religious matters. They had the true sentiment that
their consciences ought to be free, and if attempts had
been made to convince them and not to constrain them,
the end proposed would have been more easily attained.
For many an age Rome had forgotten that the weapons
of the evangelical warfare <i>are not carnal</i>. Unhappily
magistrates and reformers sometimes forgot it also. It
was an error, and the error led to the commission of
many faults.</p>

<p>Nevertheless discipline was not the essential characteristic
of Farel, Calvin, and their friends: they were
in a special degree men of faith and of a living faith.
In their eyes faith was the one thing needful—the
good thing above all others. They desired that man
should be holy and do good works; but for that, he
must believe in the love which God had shown him
in Christ. Faith, according to the reformers, is the
presiding principle of morality. If a man has faith,
he is a child of God; if he has not, he is under the
dominion of sin. Moreover Farel did not want a
purely negative reform, which should consist in merely
rejecting the pope; he wanted it to be positive, and
to that end it was necessary that the people should
believe in Jesus Christ. Lastly, Farel saw disunion
and disputes in Geneva. In order that the community,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">{410}</a></span>
the new Church, should be strong, it ought
not to be composed (he thought) of scattered members,
opposed perhaps to one another; it must form
a single body, and glorify God with one voice and
one heart. He desired, therefore, that a public profession
of faith in the Gospel should be made at Geneva.</p>

<p>As sovereignty in matters of state belongs to the
assembly of all the citizens, it was supposed with still
further reason, that to the same body, convened according
to the ancient customs, belonged the right of
proclaiming the evangelical doctrine. On Friday, the
19th of May, Farel, accompanied by Antoine Saunier,
his old travelling companion in the valleys, and by the
pastor Henri de la Mare, appeared before the council.
'Most honored lords,' he said, 'it is of great importance
for all the people to live in strict union. To get rid of
the quarrels, jeers, reproaches, and dissensions, which
the fretful disposition of our nation may occasion every
day, we must employ mildness; and, further still, we
must manifest our concord. Seeing that there is one
only truth of God, all the people should declare their
intention to adhere to it with one and the same heart.'
The council approved of the proposition, and resolved
to call together the council-general for a confession of
faith, on Sunday, the 21st of May. At Augsburg it was
the priests and doctors who had confessed the doctrine;
at Geneva, it was to be the whole nation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_747" id="Ref_747" href="#Foot_747">[747]</a></span>
The difference
between the two reforms is natural. Democracy
ruled in Geneva, and it had become all the dearer to
the citizens from their conviction that if the liberties of
nations had been taken away, the crime lay at the door
of the papacy. Calvin has repeated this more than once.
It has been said that the communes, the liberties of the
Middle Ages, issued from the furrow and the shop.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_748" id="Ref_748" href="#Foot_748">[748]</a></span>
From the <i>shop</i> came specially the liberty of Geneva.
The Burgundians who settled there were traders, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">{411}</a></span>
willingly exchanged their arms for merchandise. Some
of the heroes of Geneva, whose devotedness reminds us
of ancient times, sprang from the counter or the factory.</p>

<p class="side">=ROMAN-CATHOLICS IN GENEVA.=</p>

<p>Still an appeal to the people was a bold measure, for
there yet existed among the citizens, and even in the
council, many decided adversaries of reform, and some
of them were among the most eminent men. Might
not such an appeal stir up an opposition which would
overthrow all that had been done? The position of the
Roman-catholics was most serious. They were required
to conform to the Gospel. Could they do so? Their
consciences forbade them. Were they to refuse, they
would disturb the unanimity and harmony so necessary
to the people at that juncture. Pierre Lullin, almost a
septuagenarian, uncle of the haughty huguenot Jean
Lullin, was one of the most fervent catholics in Geneva.
Unable to do without the mass, he had asked, in September
1535, to be allowed to have it performed by a
priest in a chapel of St. Gervais, which was his private
property. Another eminent man, Syndic Balard, had
ceased indeed to be a partisan of the bishop, but he had
taken refuge in a catholicism more spiritual than Lullin's,
and yet quite as marked. According to his views, the
Holy Ghost governed the Roman-catholic church,
which church, communicating that spirit to its members,
imposed on them the obligation of finding its doctrines
in Scripture. Lullin, Balard, and some others, had
frequent conferences together. The sincere catholics
were not the only persons to be feared; they were supported
by Genevans of scant faith, who cried out
against the Reformation, principally because of its rigid
morality. The reformers themselves were not without
fear with regard to many of those who at that time
walked with them. There were men who heard the
preachers, but went no farther; they burnt the idols,
but did not reform their lives. 'For faith to be secure,
it must be governed by conscience,' said the theologians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">{412}</a></span>
'otherwise there is danger that it will be swamped, and
that the ship will founder in a stormy sea.' Were they
about to witness a renewal of those tumults which had
so often disturbed the General Councils?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_749" id="Ref_749" href="#Foot_749">[749]</a></span></p>

<p>At length the 21st of May arrived—that day at
once so longed for and so feared. The bells rang
out cheerfully; Clémence wafted through the air the
words carved on her surface: 'I summon the people.
Jesus, Saviour of men, Son of Mary, salvation of the
world! be merciful and propitious to us!' The good
citizens congratulated each other, as they obeyed the
summons, that this day would put an end to innumerable
struggles, and that the city, so long wasted by
briers and thorns, would now be covered by the hand
of God with flowers and laurels. The emotion was
universal.</p>

<p class="side">=THE QUESTION AND THE ANSWER.=</p>

<p>Besides the mass of the people, the ambassadors of
Berne were present in the church, and among them
the chief of the liberating army, Nägueli. One of the
most heroic Genevans and most sincere Christians, the
intrepid Claude Savoye, was president. When he arose
to speak, he reminded them of the flight of the bishop,
the arrival of the Gospel in Geneva, the glorious deliverance
granted to the city; and then he added, in a
voice that was heard all down the nave, 'Citizens, do you
desire to live according to the Gospel and the Word of
God, as it is preached to us every day? Do you declare
that you will have no more masses, images, idols, and
other papal abuses whatsoever? If any one knows and
wishes to say anything against the doctrine that is
preached to us, let him do so.'</p>

<p>There was a deep silence: all were in expectation.
Will not some voice, friendly to Rome or to the world,
protest against reform? The aged and devout Pierre
Lullin, the spiritual catholic Jean Balard, the frivolous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">{413}</a></span>
Jean Philippe, the episcopal Malbuisson, Richardet,
Ramel, De la Rive, and others, known for their attachment
to Rome, are going, doubtless, to take up the
premier syndic's challenge. The hour is striking;
Geneva is about to decide its future. If it is true that
the pope is Christ's vicar, and as God upon earth, let
them say so! Now or never. They wait: they wait
still; not a word disturbs the solemn silence of the
people. No one made opposition. The fact was duly
recorded. Then other accents than those which had
been anticipated resounded through the aisles of the
cathedral. Was it the voice of pious syndic Levet,
or of one of the Two Hundred, or of some one in the
body of the meeting? The council registers do not
inform us. That voice, speaking in the name of the
united nation, proclaimed: 'We all, with one accord,
desire, with God's help, to live under that holy evangelical
law, and according to God's Word as it is
preached to us. We desire to renounce all masses,
images, idols, and other papal ceremonies and abuses,
and to live in union with one another, in obedience to
justice.' When the voice ceased, all the people held up
their hands and repeating a unanimous oath, exclaimed:
'We swear it.... We will do so with God's help....
We will!'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_750" id="Ref_750" href="#Foot_750">[750]</a></span></p>

<p>The assembly broke up, and the citizens departed,
congratulating each other that the innumerable tyrannies
of '<i>Pharaoh</i>' and the darkness of the '<i>sorcerers</i>' were to
be succeeded by the mild light of Jesus Christ and the
life-giving breath of liberty. Even such huguenots as had
struggled especially for political enfranchisement, raised
no discordant voice. They knew well that if this petty
people remained catholic, it would lose its independence,
and infallibly become Savoyard. But others held higher
views: Geneva appeared to them as a fortress which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">{414}</a></span>
God had built to save the Gospel. 'God,' said Froment,
the oldest of the Genevese reformers, 'God has selected
this strong territory, so difficult of access, to form a
rampart as it were against the pope and his followers.
It is in these rude countries, guarded on the south by
the Savoy mountains and their eternal snows; on the
north by the difficult gorges of the Jura; and on the
east by the narrow passes of the St. Bernard and the
Simplon, where our friends, the Valaisans, with half a
score of men can stop an army; it is in this blessed
corner of the earth that God planted His Gospel, surrounding
his word with those gigantic fortresses, in
order that the enemy may neither reach it nor stifle it.'
While the citizens thronged the open square, the ministers
went into the pulpit. 'A mighty captain hath led
us,' they said; 'let us put our trust in him alone. He
has more power than all the kings of the earth, and
alone he has preserved us from our enemies. The captain
is Jesus Christ, our Saviour, our Redeemer, and
our strong tower.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_751" id="Ref_751" href="#Foot_751">[751]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=MEMORIAL INSCRIPTION.=</p>

<p>Farel and several Genevans asked that some monument
should be erected to recall to future ages the
memory of their great deliverance. Did not Joshua set
up twelve stones after he had crossed the Jordan?
Farel composed a Latin inscription, which was carved
in letters of gold on stone and steel. The council and
people fixed it over one of the principal gates of the city
and afterwards over the entrance to the Hôtel-de-Ville,
so that every one might read this testimony of a grateful
city.</p>

<p>The citizens who had left their homes to embrace the
faction of the bishop and the duke, and to fight against
the Reformation, were struck with the surprising deliverance
accorded to Geneva. They became friends
again, and many of them asked permission to return to
their country. Evangelical Geneva was pleased to see
those prodigal sons once more knocking at the door
of their father's house, and welcomed them on their
pledging themselves to obey the laws and contribute to
the taxes in a manner proportionate to their means.
Some of them, however, were forbidden to carry either
sword or knife, 'except for the purpose of cutting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">{416}</a></span>
bread.'—'Let us put an end to all enmities and disorders,'
said the citizens, 'and live together like good
friends.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_753" id="Ref_753" href="#Foot_753">[753]</a></span>
The priests and monks who had embraced
the Reform, were compensated for the stipends of which
they had been deprived. The state desiring to show its
gratitude to Bonivard, paid his debts, made him free of
the city, and gave him the house of the vicar-episcopal,
the dignity of a member of the Two Hundred, and a
pension of two hundred and fifty crowns. The ex-prior
of St. Victor married, thus substituting a Christian
union for the ignoble life of a monk.</p>

<p>Evangelical Geneva furnished an example of the feelings
engendered by help from heaven; patience and
meekness were displayed towards everybody. The Genevans
had read in Scripture, that 'Charity beareth all
things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
all things;' and in this spirit they acted. 'Most honored
lords, I cannot go to hear the sermon,' said the timid
Malbuisson, 'because I suffer from the gout.' This
excuse could only be met by a smile, for the gout did
not prevent him from attending the Council; but no
one desired to constrain him. If even the most zealous
sought to lead recalcitrants to the Gospel, they did not
insist. They wanted Balard to go to sermon, but he
did not; they wanted him to leave the city, but he remained;
they wanted him to close his warehouse (he
was a large ironmonger), and it was no sooner shut
than he reopened it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_754" id="Ref_754" href="#Foot_754">[754]</a></span>
He continued to be a member of
the Council and discharged all its functions. Girardet
de la Rive took his child a league from the city to have
it christened by a priest; and yet he was re-elected
syndic in 1539 and 1543, and in Calvin's time, in 1547,
was appointed one of the six commissioners for drawing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">{417}</a></span>
up the ordinances of justice. Those terrible huguenots
were kindly people at heart. They desired to give their
fellow-citizens time to compare the old life with the
new, the doctrine of the Bible with that of the pope.
The Roman-catholics kept holiday the feast days of the
Romish church, and saw their priests in secret; but
gradually their convictions were modified. As constraint
was not applied outwardly, truth acted all the
more inwardly. Those upright men read the Holy
Scriptures, and Scripture shedding a light into their
hearts, drew them day by day nearer to the truth. At
last they went to hear sermons like the rest. In the
sixteenth century Geneva was more liberal than people
of our day suppose.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_755" id="Ref_755" href="#Foot_755">[755]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=TRANSFORMATION.=</p>

<p>What a transformation had come over the city!
The Genevese, those veteran athletes, laid down their
arms at the feet of the Prince of Peace. The tumultuous
city, continually exposed to the brigandage of
the knights, to the nocturnal attacks of the Savoyards,
and to internal dissension, was transformed into a
centre of civilization. 'Let us profit by our liberty,'
said Bonivard. 'Let us make good laws and set up
a good government, for, according to the sentiment of
the emperor Marcus Aurelius, empires and great lordships
are acquired by brave and valiant captains, but
are kept up by just judges. Messieurs of Geneva,
you are indebted to God for two blessings: one, that
your republic has given birth to liberty; the other,
that, on leaving its mother's womb, it found nurses
ready to supply it with such nourishment that if you
take advantage of it your republic will be, if not immortal,
which is impossible, yet it will be of long and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">{418}</a></span>
vigorous duration.' In fact, Geneva became at once
a free city, a learned city, and an evangelical city.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_756" id="Ref_756" href="#Foot_756">[756]</a></span></p>

<p>Easter Sunday 1536 was one of the high festivals
of the renovation of this little people. Farel, stationed
at a humble table, which had replaced the
pompous altar, broke the bread and blessed the cup,
while a calm and solemn crowd drew near the symbols
of the body and blood of the Saviour. 'What a
sacrament we had,' he said, 'and what great things
the Lord hath done for us.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_757" id="Ref_757" href="#Foot_757">[757]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=MINISTERS WANTED.=</p>

<p>But he longed for still greater things. 'I pray that
He who hath increased this little flock beyond all our
expectations, may increase it still more by augmenting
our faith.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_758" id="Ref_758" href="#Foot_758">[758]</a></span>
The reformer was then almost alone
in Geneva. Froment had been summoned to Aigle,
and Viret had gone to Neuchâtel. Farel was sinking
under his labors and called loudly for help. In his
opinion the Genevans wanted a new man, some one
in his place. His incessant energy, his somewhat
coarse manner, and even the victories he had gained,
had inspired such as were wanting in religion with
prejudices that might injure the cause of the Gospel.
Farel was rather one of those who found societies
than of those who organize them; he was sensible of
this, and desired to place in other hands the definitive
establishment of the church in Geneva, in order that
he might go to new scenes where he might gain new
victories. He was like one of those noble war-horses
that neigh for the battle.</p>

<p>Where could the man of God be found to complete
the work? He was sought among the ministers, but to
no effect. The Reform was liable to perish, not from
want of work, but from want of workmen. 'Alas!'
cried Farel, 'where shall we find the preachers we require?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">{419}</a></span>
I cannot tell.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_759" id="Ref_759" href="#Foot_759">[759]</a></span>
It is true that ex-priests and
monks frequently offered themselves, but what workmen
they were! One day it was a simpleton without any
capacity; at another, a coward who did not care to
undertake a task so full of peril; one man was immoral;
another self-sufficient; a third was worldly; a fourth
altogether monkish. Farel was dismayed. 'You speak
to me of Dennis,' he said, 'but Dennis is a monk from
head to foot.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_760" id="Ref_760" href="#Foot_760">[760]</a></span>
The reformer had as much trouble in
putting these sham fellow-helpers aside, as in contending
with desperate enemies. 'Beware of the tonsure,' he
said to his friends, 'of the tonsure and the tonsured.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_761" id="Ref_761" href="#Foot_761">[761]</a></span>
'We want none of those skimmers<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_762" id="Ref_762" href="#Foot_762">[762]</a></span>
of Scripture,' he
said, 'who turn to every wind like weathercocks on the
steeples; none of those flatterers of princes and magistrates,
who wish to please them for their bellies' sake,
or through fear of being banished: none of those dissolute
monks, who seek only to please master or mistress.
No, no; none of these mercenaries; for it is to be feared
that if we take them to lead the flocks, we shall enter
into a more inextricable labyrinth than that through
which we have passed.'</p>

<p>Not only Geneva but Western Europe required 'a
God-fearing pastor,' as Farel said; a doctor who could
explain with learning the teachings of Holy Scripture;
an evangelist who, with eloquence full of life, should
convert souls to Christ; a champion who should fight
valiantly against the doctors of Rome and lead them
captive to the truth; and a man of administrative capacity
who could establish order in the churches of God.
The earth had shaken, old buildings had been thrown
down. It was requisite to erect in their place an edifice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">{420}</a></span>
more conformable with the original design—one
with more air, more light, more warmth. Where could
the man be found who, gifted with wisdom from God
like Solomon, should raise a temple to Him which
should manifest his glory? He was sought for everywhere,
perseveringly yet ineffectually. And yet the man
whom God had elected was soon to appear.</p>

 <h3>CHAPTER XV.<br />
 <span style="font-size:80%">CALVIN AT FERRARA.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Winter and Spring.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">There</span> was in Italy, as we have said in another place,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_763" id="Ref_763" href="#Foot_763">[763]</a></span>
a city in which the love of letters flourished, and where
the Gospel found a firm support: that city was Ferrara.
It was embellished by a university, bishop's palace, and
cathedral; by the castle of the ancient dukes, the palace
of Este; but its fairest ornament was Renée of France.
That princess, daughter of King Louis XII., wife of the
duke of Este, was not more distinguished by the graces
of her mind and her learning, than by the love of holiness
which shone in her, like a divine flame, according
to the testimony of one of the most learned Christians
of Italy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_764" id="Ref_764" href="#Foot_764">[764]</a></span>
For some time she had turned her attention
towards heavenly science and theological studies, and
had attracted successively to Ferrara the most eminent
Christians of Italy—Curione, Occhino, Flaminio, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">{421}</a></span>
Peter Martyr. Two young Frenchmen arrived in their
turn some time before the events we have just described.
One was called Charles d'Espeville and the other Louis
de Haulmont. They soon made their arrival known to
the duchess, who was expecting them; and Renée,
whose heart had remained French, was happy to possess
in her palace two such distinguished fellow-countrymen.
She knew that they had left their homes on account of
that Gospel of Christ which she herself had learnt to
love in the society of her dear cousin, Margaret of
Angoulême, the king's sister. She lodged them in the
Palace del Magistrato, situated in the Piazza del Duomo,
and adjoining the castle.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_765" id="Ref_765" href="#Foot_765">[765]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=RENEE AND CALVIN.=</p>

<p>Louis de Haulmont was an amiable young man, pious
but timid, still undecided as to the road he should take,
and the victim of fierce struggles. His companion,
Charles d'Espeville, was a man of humble appearance:
his eyes were lively and piercing, his manner serious
and firm, and everything in him indicated a soul of a
different stamp from that of his friend. Haulmont's
true name was Louis du Tillet; he was a canon and
archdeacon of Angoulême; Charles d'Espeville was
none other than John Calvin. As these two Frenchmen
were about to sojourn in the states of a prince,
a vassal of the pope, they were compelled (says Muratori)
to appear under a false name and in a costume
different from what they usually wore.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_766" id="Ref_766" href="#Foot_766">[766]</a></span></p>

<p>Renée, whose compassionate heart had been so often
touched by the recital of the terrible punishments and
victorious faith which animated the evangelicals, could
not look upon one of them who had escaped a dungeon
and the scaffold, without experiencing towards him the
feelings of a mother and a sister. 'She was struck with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">{422}</a></span>
Calvin's fine genius,' says a catholic historian,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_767" id="Ref_767" href="#Foot_767">[767]</a></span>
and the
perfection with which he spoke and wrote the French
language. She presented her two countrymen to the
duke, as men of letters who had come to visit the
brilliant Italy: this was a better claim to the favor of
the grandson of Pope Alexander VI. than their condition
as reformers.</p>

<p>Ferrara presented many subjects of interest to Calvin.
The duke of Este liked to play the Medici: Bernard
Tasso, a poet not without imagination, was secretary to
the duchess; and his son, the illustrious author of the
'Jerusalem Delivered,' was soon to fill the court of
Ferrara with his genius, his sorrows, his despair and
folly, caused (it is supposed) by his unhappy passion
for the beautiful Leonora, daughter of Renée, and even
to expiate by a seven years' captivity in a madhouse the
crime of having loved a granddaughter of Louis XII.
and Lucrezia Borgia. Celio Calcagnini, canon, poet,
orator, mathematician, and antiquary, who guided in the
<i>land of the Muses</i> the footsteps of the youthful Anne of
Este, who afterwards became duchess of Guise, and her
friend Olympia Morata, was then also at the court of
Este. A year sooner, the author of 'The Institutes of
the Christian Religion' might have met the author of
the 'Orlando Furioso;' but the somewhat discordant
individualities of Calvin and Ariosto were not destined
to be found side by side.</p>

<p>It was not the men of learning, however, whom the
young theologian had come to see: it was the duchess
herself. That princess, who had already received in
France a few rays of evangelical light, did not yet
possess a sufficient knowledge of Christian truth: she
felt this, and was determined to seek above all things
peace with God. She therefore had frequent interviews
with Calvin. Holy Scripture was the subject of their
conversation; the reformer explained to Renée one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">{423}</a></span>
passage by another, and the light of heaven beaming
from all these passages of Holy Writ, carried brightness
and warmth into the princess's heart. The young
doctor spoke with simplicity and modesty, but at the
same time with affection and decision. 'If I address
you, madam,' he said, 'it is not from rashness or presumption,
but pure and true affection to make you
prevail in the Lord. When I consider the pre-eminence
in which He has placed you, I think that, as a person of
princely rank, you can advance the kingdom of Jesus
Christ.' But even this consideration was not necessary
to arouse the zeal of the evangelist of Noyon. The
princess's noble character and her love for the Gospel
touched him deeply. 'I observe in you,' he added, 'such
fear of God, and such a real desire to obey Him, that I
should consider myself a castaway if I neglected the
opportunity of being useful to you.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_768" id="Ref_768" href="#Foot_768">[768]</a></span>
Calvin was the
most profound and most earnest commentator of Holy
Scripture; and Renée embraced with her whole heart
the truths that he proclaimed, so that the reformer was
able to say to her some time later: 'It has pleased
God, madam, to enlighten you with the truth of His
holy Gospel. Let us now confess that if God has withdrawn
us from the depths of darkness, it is in order
that we should follow the light straightforwardly, turning
neither to this side nor to that.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_769" id="Ref_769" href="#Foot_769">[769]</a></span>
The duchess
profited by this advice. 'Calvin,' says Muratori, 'so
infected Renée with his errors that it was never possible
to extract from her heart the poison she had drunk.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_770" id="Ref_770" href="#Foot_770">[770]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=A CHRISTIAN WALK.=</p>

<p>An open Christian walk was difficult at a court where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">{424}</a></span>
popery and worldliness ruled together. Hence Renée
felt keenly the need of directions in harmony with the
Word of God; and in her difficulties and agonies, at the
times when she was about to faint, 'as if she was sunk
in water almost over her head,' she had recourse to the
evangelical theologian. Calvin then invited her always
to walk 'forwards, in order that the gifts of God might
increase in her.' 'The main point,' as he wrote to her
some time after, 'is that the holy doctrine of our Master
should so transform us in mind and heart, that His glory
may shine forth in us by innocence, integrity, and holiness.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_771" id="Ref_771" href="#Foot_771">[771]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the most illustrious divines of Roman-catholicism
have been, in France and other countries,
the directors of princes; but there was a great difference
between them and the reformer. That practical evangelist,
whom Romish controversialists and others have
reproached with speaking of nothing but doctrines,
urged the daughter of Louis XII. to 'seek after <i>innocence</i>,
<i>integrity</i>, and <i>holiness</i>.'</p>

<p>The relations of Calvin with the duchess lasted all his
life, and they were always marked with frankness and
respect. Touched with a zeal so Christian and so pure,
she loved and honored him, 'as long as he lived,' says
Theodore Beza, 'as an excellent instrument of the Lord.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_772" id="Ref_772" href="#Foot_772">[772]</a></span>
Even when he could no longer hold a pen on account
of his extreme weakness, Calvin, borrowing the hand of
his brother, wrote to her; and to her were addressed
the last three French epistles of the reformer.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_773" id="Ref_773" href="#Foot_773">[773]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=THE COUNTESS OF MARENNES.=</p>

<p>The duchess of Ferrara was not the only person whom
Calvin called at that time to a Christian life. 'Many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">{425}</a></span>
others, especially among those about her person, were
<i>seduced</i>,' says Muratori; that is to say, brought over to
evangelical truth.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_774" id="Ref_774" href="#Foot_774">[774]</a></span>
These conversions, probably, must
not be ascribed solely to Calvin: some, like Renée, had
already enjoyed a certain knowledge of the Gospel;
others were afterwards strengthened in their faith; but
all received something from the young reformer. Soon
after his arrival at the court of Ferrara, Calvin had remarked
a lady of great intelligence and learning, who was
one of its principal ornaments. This was Anne de Parthenay,
first lady of honor to the duchess, and wife of
Antoine de Pons, count of Marennes, first gentleman to
the duke. The countess of Marennes was a great musician,
and often sang in the duchess's apartments, where
she was admired for the beauty of her voice.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_775" id="Ref_775" href="#Foot_775">[775]</a></span>
But Anne
busied herself with more serious labors. Not satisfied
with studying the Latin authors, she had a taste for Greek,
and 'intrepidly' translated the poets and prose writers.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_776" id="Ref_776" href="#Foot_776">[776]</a></span>
That eminent woman did more: she read books of divinity,
and even took a particular pleasure in 'discussing
almost every day with the theologians the matters of
which they treated.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_777" id="Ref_777" href="#Foot_777">[777]</a></span>
She therefore talked with Calvin
on these subjects, and before long the pure and living
faith of the reformer gave a new direction to her soul.
Hitherto she had been somewhat of a 'blue-stocking,'
but now she 'ceased to have any confidence in herself,'
and sought in the holy books and in her Saviour the
means of quenching the thirst for knowledge and the
divine life which tormented her. From that hour she
became a new creature and a 'good huguenot.' She
even won over her husband to the convictions that were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">{426}</a></span>
dear to herself, and, so long as the countess lived, the
latter showed himself a great lover of virtue and of
truth.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_778" id="Ref_778" href="#Foot_778">[778]</a></span></p>

<p>Adjoining the hall of Aurora, where Renée and her
court usually assembled, was a chapel adorned by the
pencil of Titian. Until now Calvin had only spoken
in the duchess's apartments, and respect naturally prevented
the servants (according to the historians of the
Roman church) 'from inquiring too curiously into what
occurred there.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_779" id="Ref_779" href="#Foot_779">[779]</a></span>
But ere long Renée began to think
that she ought not to keep for herself only and a few
court favorites the words of life and light which fell
from the lips of the French divine. While listening
to them, she had felt the bitterness of sin and the fear
of God's judgments; but she had at the same time
tasted the sweets of pardon and eternal life. Ought
not others to enjoy them also? Should she prevent
those from entering who desired to enter?</p>

<p>Calvin was ready. Renée invited him to preach in
Titian's chapel. Had he not preached in the catholic
churches of Noyon, Angoumois, and Poitou? The
duchess threw open the doors of that service to all
who desired to take part in it. The count of Marennes
and his wife, the youthful Jean de Parthenay,
seigneur of Soubise and brother to the countess, with
other members of that family, the count of Mirambeau,
Anne of Beauregard, Clement Marot, and Leon
Jamet, the ex-clerk of finance, who had fled from
Paris after the affair of the Placards—were all present
at these meetings.</p>

<p>The charms which French people found in a French
service might excuse these assemblies in the eyes of
the duke of Este. But they were soon joined by
learned Italians, friends of the Gospel, and among
others by Giovanni Sinapi and his brother, as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">{427}</a></span>
as by the pious, sprightly, and beautiful Francesca
Baciro, whom Giovanni Sinapi married two years
later.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_780" id="Ref_780" href="#Foot_780">[780]</a></span>
At this epoch so glorious for Italy, when
Curione taught at Pavia, protected by the admiration
of his hearers; when Aonio Paleario at Sienna glorified
Jesus Christ, 'the king of every people;' when
Mollio at Bologna commented on the Epistles of Saint
Paul to the great scandal of the pope; when Juan
Valdes, Peter Martyr, and Occhino filled Naples with
the Gospel; when Christ's truth seemed to be gliding
even into Rome itself, a Frenchman, under the patronage
of a French princess, was announcing in Ferrara
the same Gospel, but with a voice even more distinct.
What a future for Italy, if Rome had not extinguished
these lights! There was gathered around the preacher
a serious and friendly audience in the chapel of the
castle of Ferrara.</p>

<p>Calvin, full of the truths he had just set forth in his
<i>Institutes</i>, 'put forward that Word of the Lord whose
majesty by a holy violence constrains souls to obey it,'
and showed that this 'Gospel, whose smallness many
folks despised, as if it crouched at their feet, so far surpassed
the range of the human mind that the greatest
geniuses lift their eyes in vain, for they can never see
the top.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_781" id="Ref_781" href="#Foot_781">[781]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=ANNE OF BEAUREGARD.=</p>

<p>Among the persons whose heart sought after God was
the beautiful Anne of Beauregard, who, though still very
young, had accompanied Renée to Ferrara. Being betrothed,
and all radiant with the joy of her youth, she
was soon to be called to other altars than those of marriage.
Falling ill, she profited by the Word she had
heard, and, content with Christ alone, despised the
world. Death cut down that beautiful flower. Renée
regretted her bitterly; all the court wept with her;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">{428}</a></span>
and Marot, who was then at Ferrara, wrote these melancholy
lines upon her tomb:</p>

</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The count of Marennes, a man of no decision of character,
often attended Calvin's preaching. He was rather
afraid that the duke, his master, would be displeased;
still the duchess herself had arranged these meetings.
The countess, his wife, whose humble servant he was,
asked him to join them; his brother-in-law, Soubise,
also invited him; Marennes, therefore, followed the
others to chapel, being urged from without and not from
within.</p>

<p class="side">=ZEAL OF SOUBISE.=</p>

<p>Soubise, on the contrary, an independent man, of
noble, decided, and energetic character, went with his
whole heart, and, after Renée, was the best conquest of
the Gospel at Ferrara. In that fanatical age it was
choosing a hard and miserable life; but the Gospel
Word had conquered him, and he was determined to
walk among the thorns. 'John of Soubise, a hero of
the sixteenth century,' says Moreri, 'suffered himself to
be perverted at the court of the duke of Ferrara, when
Renée of France received there certain doctors of the
pretended reformed religion.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_783" id="Ref_783" href="#Foot_783">[783]</a></span>
He had been trained
for the profession of arms; he now found at Calvin's
side the sword of the Word of God, and returning into
France courageously 'occupied himself in defending the
truths he had believed.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_784" id="Ref_784" href="#Foot_784">[784]</a></span>
A gentleman of the king's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">{429}</a></span>
chamber, a knight of the Order, having had command
of the French army in Italy, a man of great resources
and great service, 'having effected a hundred masterstrokes,'
he was, above all, very zealous for God; and,
without neglecting the important affairs of the kingdom,
he sought the salvation of the humblest tenant on his
estates. A good old pastor, Mulot des Ruisseaux,
'impelled by the singular virtue of the lord of that  place'
(Soubise), used to leave his house at the approach of
night—the only time when evangelical Christians dared
meet together—and visit the adjoining districts, everywhere
teaching the Scriptures. More than once, on
hearing the signal of alarm, he had to hide in the woods
and pass the night there. In a short time a great part
of the people had forsaken mass.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_785" id="Ref_785" href="#Foot_785">[785]</a></span>
Soubise even desired
to convert Catherine de Medicis, and with that view held
long conversations with the queen,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_786" id="Ref_786" href="#Foot_786">[786]</a></span>
and the crafty
Italian woman led him to hope for a moment that she
was on the point of turning Protestant. The trouble
that he had taken was not entirely lost. The duchess of
Bourbon Montpensier, 'a woman of virile character and
of wisdom beyond her sex,' as De Thou describes her,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_787" id="Ref_787" href="#Foot_787">[787]</a></span>
being present at Soubise's conversations with Catherine
de Medicis, received the truths which he was explaining
to another; and somewhat later two of that lady's
daughters, the duchess of Bouillon and the princess of
Orange, bravely professed the doctrines of the Reformation.</p>

<p>By his only daughter, Catherine of Parthenay,
Soubise was grandfather of the celebrated duke of
Rohan.</p>

<p>It was not only among his compatriots at Ferrara
that Calvin was a fisher of men. The traditions of
certain families of the peninsula place several eminent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">{430}</a></span>
Italians<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_788" id="Ref_788" href="#Foot_788">[788]</a></span>
among the number of those who heard and received
light from him. One of them was a Neapolitan
nobleman, the duke of Bevilacqua, then at Ferrara.
His ancestors, who descended from the Boileaux, barons
of Castelnau, a family which in France has produced
many distinguished men, were of Languedocian origin,
and had been compelled by the persecutions directed
against the Vaudois and Albigenses in the thirteenth
century to take refuge in the kingdom of Naples.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_789" id="Ref_789" href="#Foot_789">[789]</a></span>
Bevilacqua discovered at Ferrara, in Calvin's teaching,
the truth for which his forefathers had been compelled
to leave France.</p>

<p>Another Italian, more eminent still, who used to
attend these evangelical assemblies, was Titian, then
about the age of fifty-eight. That great painter, who
had decorated the castle of duke Alphonso of Este, was
again at Ferrara. Possessing a calm, solid, judicious,
and truth-loving mind, devoted to nature, and seeking
to represent her in all her truth, Titian was naturally
struck with the pure and living religion which Calvin
preached. The great artist was no stranger to the deep
affections of the soul, and the sublimest heroism in his
eyes was the devotedness of the Christians, who sacrificed
their lives for their faith. There are no scenes
more terrible and pathetic than those represented in
his pictures of martyrs. Nurtured with the writings of
Dante, Petrarch, and other great men of Italy, who had
shown themselves opposed to the abuses of the popes
and their adherents, Titian could applaud the opposition
led by the young Frenchman against the papacy.
But if at that time he greeted evangelical truths with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">{431}</a></span>
admiration, there is no evidence that they sank very
deeply into his heart. It would appear that Bevilacqua
asked him to paint Calvin's portrait; but however that
may be, the portrait still exists in the palace of the duke
of Bevilacqua at Naples.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_790" id="Ref_790" href="#Foot_790">[790]</a></span>
There is no indication that
Titian preserved the impressions he received at Ferrara.
'Among those who seem touched by the beauty of the
Gospel,' says Calvin, 'there is scarcely one out of ten in
whose heart the Word of God is not stifled.' Titian
was, no doubt, an instance of the truth of the fact indicated
by the Reformer.</p>

<p class="side">=THE WORD STIFLED BY THE WORLD.=</p>

<p>Calvin had been a faithful and active workman in his
Master's vineyard, yet he did not always meet with
friendly and docile hearers, even in Ferrara. Among
the persons forming the duchess's court, he had noticed
a cringing person with insinuating manners, whose look
and expression displeased him greatly. That man, by
name Master François, chaplain to Renée was one of
those double-hearted people who wish to satisfy God
and their own cupidity. Calvin had heard that the life
of that priest was far from saintly. 'I do not interfere,'
he answered, when called upon to declare his opinion as
to the chaplain's superstitious doctrines—'I do not interfere,
for if I laid myself out to speak evil of him, I
should have to speak of far different matters, on which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">{432}</a></span>
I remain silent.' Master François, seeing the favor
which the young stranger enjoyed at court, assumed an
air of being convinced by his words, appeared to become
his friend, and began to preach as evangelically as he
could. He raised no objections to Calvin's meetings,
but prevailed on the duchess to be present at mass also,
which he continued to say, notwithstanding his evangelical
appearances. Such a man could not please the
upright and inflexible reformer. 'When I see any one
extinguishing the light of truth,' he wrote one day to
Renée, 'I cannot forgive him, were he a hundred times
my father.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_791" id="Ref_791" href="#Foot_791">[791]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin tried, therefore, to convince François that the
celebration of what he called 'the sacrifice at the altar'
was contrary to Holy Scripture. Whenever the chaplain
went astray the reformer admonished him. 'I have
often tried to bring him into the true path,' he said.
The priest would then appear sorrowful, and ashamed
of his weakness, and Calvin, pressing him still more
closely, would succeed in 'making him confess his
iniquity.' But human respect still prevailed in François,
and if any one about the court happened to be present
at his conversations with the reformer, he would make
excuses for himself before them.</p>

<p class="side">=THE CHAPLAIN AND THE INSTITUTES.=</p>

<p>One day, finding his discourses useless, Calvin determined
to present him with 'a treatise of his;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_792" id="Ref_792" href="#Foot_792">[792]</a></span>
that
is all he says. He does not mention the title of this
work; but as it cannot have been either his commentary
on Seneca's <i>De Clementiâ</i> or the <i>Psychopannichia</i>, it was
evidently the <i>Institutes of the Christian Religion</i>, which
he had just printed at Basle—these three works being
at that time all the reformer had written. Even on the
supposition that Calvin had left Basle before the actual
publication of his book, it would have been very natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">{433}</a></span>
for him to take a copy with him when starting for Italy.
Master François opened that volume, which, by God's
grace, has imprinted indelible convictions in so many
minds. This is the first notice we have of the reading
of the <i>Institutes</i>: it is mentioned by Calvin himself, and
took place during his Italian journey, in the castle of
Lucrezia Borgia's son. These circumstances impart to
it a peculiar interest. François probably did not read
the whole treatise. The mass was the subject of difference
between him and Calvin, and consequently it
was that part of his work to which the latter referred
him. There was much in it calculated to disturb the
chaplain. 'Christ,' said the treatise, 'being immortal,
has been appointed by God everlasting priest; he
has no need then for others to succeed him. Now
do not those priests who offer sacrifice every day put
themselves in Christ's place, and rob him of the prerogative
of his eternal sacrifice?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_793" id="Ref_793" href="#Foot_793">[793]</a></span>
Further on he adds: 'The
mass being established in such a manner that a hundred
thousand sacrifices are offered up daily, swamps and
buries the sacrifice of Christ which was offered as <i>sole</i>
sacrifice. To set up an altar now is to pull down the
cross of Jesus Christ. The mass blots out of the remembrance
of men the Saviour's true and only death.'
And still further on the chaplain read: 'The mass robs
us of the fruits which resulted to us from the death of
Christ; for who will believe himself redeemed by that
death, when a new redemption is presented to him in the
mass?' Other considerations put forward by Calvin in
his book, were equally calculated to convince the priest.</p>

<p>Calvin who was not deficient in classical recollections
and who anticipated a second Iliad in which the
princes of the earth would meet—some to retain the
mass, others to remove it—compares it, in conclusion,
to that woman of antiquity, so notorious by the impure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">{434}</a></span>
passions and the cruel war she stirred up. 'Assuredly,'
he exclaimed, 'Satan never constructed a stronger
machine to attack the kingdom of Jesus Christ.
Behold that Helen under whose eyes the enemies of
the truth are fighting with so much rage, with whom
they commit adultery, and plunge into a spiritual
impurity which is the most detestable of all.' He then
draws up and displays the long catalogue of 'great and
serious abuses' which the mass has engendered, namely,
disgraceful markets, illicit and dishonest gains, great
extortions—all kinds of impurity, idolatry, sacrilege,
and other 'consequences' that we omit.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN AND FRANCOIS.=</p>

<p>The priest was greatly agitated. The beauty of
the language, the clearness of style, the energy of
expression, the powerful logic, the strength of affection,
the rapidity and seriousness of the reproaches,
the accusations and recriminations which fell upon
his soul, like hailstones in a storm, and above all
the idea that the mass robbed Christ of his cross and
his crown, and insulted his divinity, alarmed François
who had imagined nothing of the sort. He was 'convinced
in his conscience;' he thought himself really
guilty and exposed to great danger, while his anguish
increased more and more. He hastened to the reformer,
and there (says Calvin), 'he protested with
strong oaths he would never assist at the mass, it
being so great an abomination.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_794" id="Ref_794" href="#Foot_794">[794]</a></span>
The chaplain's
emotion was sincere, only it was not permanent. He
soon relapsed into his habitual condition, and recommenced
preaching the word of God 'solely because
he thought he might thus catch benefices and other
prey.' At a later period Calvin wrote of him: 'Madam,
I know my man so well that I do not value his oath
more than the chattering of a magpie. If persons who
can raise him to dignities, or are rich enough to fill
his wallet, ask him to give glory to God, he will take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">{435}</a></span>
pains to gratify them; but if any persecution should
come, he will be quite ready to renounce the Gospel.
He plays different parts at different times. It is not
the duty of a Christian to speak ill of his neighbor,
but there is no one with whom I wage such fierce war
as with those who, under the cloak of the Gospel, play
the hypocrite with princes, and by their cunning and
tricks keep them always enveloped in clouds, without
leading them to the true goal.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_795" id="Ref_795" href="#Foot_795">[795]</a></span>
This man,' he said, 'is
convinced in his conscience, and yet he continues doing
what he acknowledges to be wrong.' He added: 'All
the hatred which I have shown him hitherto is, that I
have endeavored with all my power to edify him in
what is right.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_796" id="Ref_796" href="#Foot_796">[796]</a></span>
Such were the struggles which the
valiant champion of the Gospel had to maintain in the
palace of the dukes of Este.</p>

<p>One of the duchess's ladies—her name is not known—who
had found peace with God in the Saviour's
death, refused to be present at mass. François attempted
to convince her, but the young lady remained
firm as a rock. 'She would not offend her conscience.'
The angry priest complained to the duchess and did
all in his power to deprive the young maid of honor
of the kindly feeling which Renée was accustomed to
show towards her. Before long the duchess herself
was 'warned,' that those who 'conducted themselves
like that young lady' would not be tolerated, seeing
that they would give occasion for scandal. The princess,
knowing full well that the duke would not permit
any one at court to reject the mass, was in great distress,
and Calvin was informed of it by the countess of Marennes.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_797" id="Ref_797" href="#Foot_797">[797]</a></span>
The enemies of the Reformation added falsehood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">{436}</a></span>
to violence. The confessor tried to make the
duchess believe that the churches of Germany had not
discussed the matter, but that they admitted the mass.
Calvin complained loudly of the great injury done to
the churches of God. 'All the churches that have
received the Gospel,' he wrote a little later, 'and even
all individuals hold this article—that the mass ought
not to be endured. Even Capito, one of those who
endeavors earnestly to <i>moderate</i> matters, teaches in a
work dedicated to the king of England, that it is the
duty of Christian princes to drive from their realms
such a detestable idolatry. There is now not a single
man of reputation who is not of that opinion.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_798" id="Ref_798" href="#Foot_798">[798]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN WRITES TO DUCHEMIN.=</p>

<p>During his residence at Ferrara, Calvin was not
satisfied with combating the errors of those who surrounded
him: he did not forget France, to which his
heart was always attached; and he watched, although
from afar, the friends he had left there. The superstitions
of Italy and the profane spirit displayed by the
priests in the midst of their relics and empty ceremonies,
produced the same effect upon him as upon Luther, and
made him all the more desirous to see his fellow-countrymen
withdraw from the authority of the pope.
He was therefore deeply moved by the news which
reached him at this time. Nicholas Duchemin, with
whom he had lived at Orleans, whose character he
esteemed, and of whom he had said, 'that he was dearer
to him than his life,' had been appointed official or
ecclesiastical judge, which brought him into close
relations with the Roman clergy and worship. Calvin
was alarmed and sent him a letter which, revised and
enlarged, was published under this title: <i>How we must
avoid the papal ceremonies and superstitions, and observe
the Christian religion with purity</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_799" id="Ref_799" href="#Foot_799">[799]</a></span>
'I do not mean,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">{437}</a></span>
said Calvin to his friend, 'that you should make a
conscience of things which it is not in your power to
escape, and with regard to which you should be free.
I do not forbid your entering the temples which surround
you, although numberless examples of impiety
are witnessed in them daily. Although the images are
consecrated to detestable sacrileges, I do not forbid you
to look at them. It would not even be in your power,
for the streets are full of a multitude of idols. But
have a care lest a too great license should make you
overstep the bounds of liberty.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_800" id="Ref_800" href="#Foot_800">[800]</a></span></p>

<p>Duchemin was very sensible of the danger, and wishing
to be at the same time faithful to the Gospel, and to
preserve an advantageous appointment, had put this
question to Calvin: 'How can I keep myself pure
among the pollutions of Babylon?' Calvin showed him,
as he had shown François, that the mass was the most
dangerous enemy.</p>

<p>'Do not believe,' he said, 'in that conjuror who
approaches the altar and begins to play his tricks, now
turning this side, now that; at one time resting motionless,
at another muttering his magic murmurs, by means
of which he pretends to draw Christ down from heaven
to make reconciliation between God and man, and thus
substitute himself for the Saviour dead and raised
again.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_801" id="Ref_801" href="#Foot_801">[801]</a></span></p>

<p>The more Calvin reflected on Duchemin's position the
more it alarmed him. He thought himself on the point
of losing one of the earliest objects of his tender affection.
A few moments longer on the verge of the abyss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">{438}</a></span>
and his friend would fall into it. He called to him with
all his strength and with a cry of anguish. 'I feel very
great regret for your condition,' he said. 'I am sorry
that you are not permitted to extricate yourself from
that Egypt where so many monsters are always before
you. A man thinks to himself that it is of no great importance
to trifle a little in order to preserve the favor of
the people, and to take part with others in wicked ceremonies.
Then one foot is placed a little further on, and
thus declining gradually, he falls from the straight path,
and is precipitated to ruin and perdition. Let us be
careful never to recede, even a nail's breadth, from the
obedience due to our heavenly Father. Awake, then,
awake, most virtuous man! Display in your actions
such piety, goodness, charity, chastity, and innocence,
that the superstitious, even while vexed that you are not
like them, may be constrained to confess, whether they
will or not, that you are the servant of God.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_802" id="Ref_802" href="#Foot_802">[802]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S APPEAL TO ROUSSEL.=</p>

<p>It was not long before the Reformer received still
more distressing news. It was not merely a disciple,
it was a teacher who grieved him. One of the men
whom he esteemed the most was not only exposed to
peril, but had succumbed. Calvin learnt that, on the
death of Pierre d'Albret, bishop of Oleron, Queen
Margaret of Navarre, who was falling away from evangelical
simplicity, had sent to Rome to beg the vacant see
for Roussel; and that, after some difficulty, the court of
the Vatican had granted the favor. Roussel a bishop,
and by favor of the pope! Calvin was amazed. People
wrote to him that the appointment had been celebrated
by the poets of Bearne, and that Roussel was overwhelmed
with congratulations; and Calvin wondered
whether his friend, amid the seducing songs of the sirens,
would lend an ear to his warnings. He determined,
however, to give utterance to the solemn voice of faithfulness.
The stern language he addressed to the new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">{439}</a></span>
bishop shows us, more clearly than the cleverest portrait,
the great decision of his soul.</p>

<p>'It will seem to you that I dream,' he wrote to Roussel,
'if alone among the multitude of those who flatter you,
I come to disturb the rejoicings. And yet, if you suffer
yourself in the least degree to be cozened by such prettinesses,
they will lead you into a heavy and dangerous
forgetfulness. Those who have once drunk, be it but a
little drop, of that cup of the Roman table, are intoxicated
and bewitched.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_803" id="Ref_803" href="#Foot_803">[803]</a></span></p>

<p>Calvin pictured to himself the magnificent state of his
friend, the great splendor, the grand appearance, the
mitre, crosier, mantle and ring, and all the rest of the
paraphernalia with which he was bedizened; the riches,
the pomp displayed in his household, the long train of
servants, the dainty table, and a thousand other forms
of luxury and superfluity, and exclaimed: 'Now that
you have become the favorite of fortune, remember that
He who appointed bishops (that is, God) wills that,
while the people sleep, they should be in a watch-tower
on a hill, casting their eyes on all around them, and that
their voice should be like the sound of a trumpet. With
what faithfulness do you labor to raise up that which
has fallen? True religion is defamed, mocked at, trodden
under foot, and even entirely ruined; the poor
people are deceived, abused, plundered by a thousand
frauds, and led to slaughter ... and all that is
done before your eyes! You not only let these things
pass, but there is hardly any impiety in your diocese
which you do not sanction by your seal!</p>

<p>'What ought to be done with one who, like you,
deserts his captain, passes over to the enemy, and
damages the camp in whose defence he had sworn to
employ his life?</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">{440}</a></div>

<p>'Blow the trumpet, watchman! Arm thyself, shepherd!
Why waitest thou? Of what art thou thinking?
Is this a time for sleep? What! a murderer, guilty of
shedding blood, every drop of which the Lord will require
of thee again! And thou art not afraid?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_804" id="Ref_804" href="#Foot_804">[804]</a></span></p>

<p>'O Rome, Rome! how many good people thou corruptest
who otherwise were not ill-born? How many
among those already corrupted whom thou makest worse
daily? How many of those whom thou hast debauched,
whom thou plungest into eternal perdition?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_805" id="Ref_805" href="#Foot_805">[805]</a></span></p>

<p>'O my dear Roussel, come out of that slough as soon
as possible, for fear lest while lingering in it you should
sink deeper and deeper into the mire.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_806" id="Ref_806" href="#Foot_806">[806]</a></span></p>

<p>'You will say, I know: "What then will become of us
poor wretches? Must we, who live at our ease, go into
foreign lands, like needy vagabonds? Must we, who
always have our pantry and cellar full, without any
toil, live upon coarse fare procured by the sweat of our
brows and the labor of our hands?"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_807" id="Ref_807" href="#Foot_807">[807]</a></span></p>

<p>'If you find such a life strange, you are not a true
Christian. It is very hard, I confess, to leave one's
birthplace to be a wanderer and a stranger. And yet
the Lord, who is a marvellous worker, contrives that
this poverty, so bitter in the opinion of men, is made
pleasing to them, and that, tempered with a heavenly
sweetness, it procures them especial pleasure.'</p>

<p>Thus the young man of twenty-seven was already a
teacher abounding in energy and good sense. These
two letters, which (according to the most trustworthy
evidence) were written at Ferrara, would of themselves
be sufficient to mark his residence in that city with a
special character. It was then he began to appear, to
speak, and to lead with the authority of a reformer. In
him God gave His church a teacher gifted with that
indomitable firmness which, notwithstanding all obstacles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">{441}</a></span>
and all seductions, is able to break with error
and to uphold the truth. At the same time He gave a
man whose activity was not to be limited to the place
where he lived, but whose wide spirit would embrace all
Christendom, and who would be able to send into
France, the Low Countries, England, Poland, and
wherever it became necessary, the words of wisdom
and of faith.</p>

<p>Calvin taught not only by his words but by his example.
He might have been able, by softening down
some expressions in the Gospel, to remain in the palace
of the dukes of Este, and to enjoy the favor of princes.
But if he required fidelity and renunciation in Roussel,
he first possessed them himself. He made the sacrifices
to which he invited others, and was ready to exchange
the pleasures and brilliancy of a court for the horrors of
a prison, or of a flight environed with danger. Calvin
remained firm, as 'seeing Him who is invisible,' and
preferred to be afflicted with the people of God rather
than have a part in the joys of the great ones of the
earth. This spirit of self-denial characterized him to the
last. The friend of princes, the councillor of kings, he
lived humbly, having scarcely the means of supplying
the ordinary wants of life.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S INFLUENCE IN ITALY.=</p>

<p>It is said that Calvin visited Padua, Venice, and even
Rome; but it does not appear that history can accept
this tradition. It is probable that all the time he spent
beyond the Alps was passed near the Duchess Renée.
His influence, however, extended beyond the palaces
and the principality of the dukes of Este. One of the
men who may be considered the best judges, one of the
literary historians of the peninsula, the jesuit Tiraboschi,
declares that Calvin's sojourn at the court of Ferrara
was more injurious to Italy than all the soldiers, active
disciples of Luther, who propagated his doctrines there.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_808" id="Ref_808" href="#Foot_808">[808]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">{442}</a></span>
And yet Calvin scarcely quitted Ferrara. Just when
the star of Ariosto, which had shone over that city, had
set, and when that of Tasso was about to appear, the
star of Calvin shone there with a purer light than that
of the bard of Orlando or of Godfrey. But the faithful
Christian could not long remain in the bosom of worldliness
and popery without suffering from their violent
attacks. Calvin's sojourn was about to end in a tragic
and unexpected manner.</p>

occasion, and offered him a copy of it. I have had many opportunities
of seeing it at London in Sir John's house.' M. de
Triqueti, whose words we have just quoted, speaks of another
portrait of Calvin painted by Titian, purchased in 1860, at a public
sale in Paris. We ourselves have seen in one of the Italian
picture galleries a portrait of Calvin also assigned to Titian.
There is one in the public library of Geneva, and several are to be
found in various Italian museums (Stählin: <i>Johannes Calvin</i>, ii. p.
7); but these are rather pictures painted by Titian's pupils and
touched up by the master, as was the custom of the teacher and
his students in those days.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Duke Hercules</span> of Este had remarked that certain
changes had taken place since the arrival of the Frenchman.
Calvin's discussion with François the chaplain
could not be kept secret. Borgia's grandson knew that
the pope, under the pretence of heresy, might deprive
him of his states; already his father, Duke Alphonso,
through being on bad terms with Rome, had passed
many years in exile. The Inquisition had a tribunal at
Ferrara, and what was going on at court was more than
enough to alarm it. A report had been made to the
pope; Charles V. had been informed; and Paul III.
proposed a treaty to the duke, in which there was a
secret article stipulating the removal of all the French
then at Ferrara; but there was one among them for
whom a severer fate was reserved. The duke, retracting
the indulgence he had conceded to his wife, declared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">{443}</a></span>
that he was resolved to put an end to the schismatic intrigues
of which the court was the theatre; that the
count and countess of Marennes, Soubise, the other
gentleman, and even Marot, must quit his states; 'and
as for M. d'Espeville,' he added, 'know, madam, that if
he is discovered, he will forthwith be dragged to punishment
on account of religion.'<span

<p class="side">=TRIALS OF RENEE.=</p>

<p>This order was like a thunderstroke to Renée.
Called to leave the land of her ancestors, she had
created a little France at Ferrara; and now, all who
gave her any comfort in her exile were about to be torn
from her. Rome would deprive her of that pious and
learned teacher who had given her such good counsel;
perhaps he would expiate on an Italian scaffold the
crime of having proclaimed the Gospel. All the lords
and ladies of the court, and even the satirical Marot,
were to leave Ferrara. Leon Jamet seems to have been
the only Frenchman permitted to stay; the duchess,
who required a secretary, had obtained her husband's
permission for this ex-clerk of the treasury to remain
with her in that character. Thus the daughter of
Louis XII., after the bright days she had enjoyed, was
condemned to remain almost alone in her palace, as
in a gloomy chamber; her slightest movements were
watched; she was tormented by priests whom she
despised, and exposed by the grandson of Borgia to
unjust harshness. Marot, touched by so many misfortunes,
and knowing the part which the queen of
Navarre, Renée's cousin, would take in this great trial,
addressed her in these touching lines:</p>

<p>Renée was to suffer a pain still greater than that
caused by the dismissal 'beyond the mountains' of her
friends from France. That iniquitous institution, decorated
with the name of the <i>Holy Office</i>, which was
destined a little later to make thousands of martyrs in
Spain, the Netherlands, and other countries, desired for
the moment to strike the teacher who had excited the
greatest terror and hatred at Rome. The Inquisition
had discovered Calvin's residence. His name and his
<i>crime</i> were inscribed in the black-book of that cruel
institution.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_811" id="Ref_811" href="#Foot_811">[811]</a></span>
Heresy was flourishing at the court of
Este; the chief culprit was pointed out, and if the
others were allowed to depart, he at least must be
punished.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S ARREST.=</p>

<p>Calvin, forewarned of what was going on, was at the
palace Del Magistrato, where he and Du Tillet lived,
and was hurriedly getting ready for his departure,
when the agents of the inquisitors, who were on the
watch, arrived, seized the 'pestiferous disturber,' and
dragged him away a prisoner.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_812" id="Ref_812" href="#Foot_812">[812]</a></span>
It was not their intention
to leave him in a place where the evangelical doctor
possessed many influential friends. They determined
to have him tried at Bologna, a city in the States of the
Pope, not far distant from Ferrara, where they would be
entirely the masters. The young Frenchman was therefore
placed in the charge of some familiars of the Holy
Office, and guarded by them was to proceed to that
ancient city which boasted of possessing within its walls
the ashes of St. Dominick, the founder of the Inquisition.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">{445}</a></div>

<p>Calvin began the journey, surrounded by the men appointed
to conduct him. He might then have said of
himself, as he afterwards said of another: 'Although
he hopes still, he is assailed by a hundred deaths, so
that there is not an opening, be it ever so small, for
escape.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_813" id="Ref_813" href="#Foot_813">[813]</a></span>
The tribunal of the Inquisition, which was
never tender, would certainly not be so towards a heretic
of this kind. The squadron which had him in charge,
turning towards the south, crossed a fertile country and
proceeded without obstacle towards the city of Bologna.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_814" id="Ref_814" href="#Foot_814">[814]</a></span>
They had already gone more than halfway, when some
armed men suddenly made their appearance.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_815" id="Ref_815" href="#Foot_815">[815]</a></span>
They
stopped the escort, and ordered them to release their
prisoner. We do not know whether there was any
resistance; but this much is certain, that the inquisitors,
little accustomed to yield, saw the doctor taken from
them whom they were conducting to certain death.
Calvin was set at liberty<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_816" id="Ref_816" href="#Foot_816">[816]</a></span>
and strained every nerve to
get out of Italy.</p>

<p>His sojourn in that country, as we read of it in
authentic documents, is far from being a blank page, as
some have supposed. The last event that we have
mentioned, according to Muratori, has even a particular
interest. It reminds us of a well-known circumstance
in the history of the German reformation, when Luther,
returning from Worms, was carried off by horsemen
masked and armed from head to foot. But Calvin's
case was more serious than that of the Saxon reformer,
who was taken to a castle belonging to friends, beyond
the reach of danger; while Calvin was left alone, almost
in the middle of Italy, and forced to make his way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">{446}</a></span>
through a hostile country, where he ran the risk of
being arrested again.</p>

<p>It has been asked who snatched this choice prey from
the tribunals of Rome, and even in the states of the
pope; whence did the blow proceed?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_817" id="Ref_817" href="#Foot_817">[817]</a></span>
It was bold
and rash; it exposed its contrivers and agents to great
danger, for the papacy and the Inquisition were all-powerful
in Italy. A strong affection, a great respect
for the reformer, and boundless devotion to the cause of
truth, can alone account for such an audacious adventure.
One person only in the Italian peninsula was
capable of contriving it and of carrying it out, and that
was—is it necessary to say?—the daughter of Louis XII.
Everybody ascribed the reformer's liberation to
her. It might be expected that the Inquisition, always
so suspicious and severe, would be implacable in its
vengeance. Renée escaped, at least for the moment.
It is possible that Hercules of Este exerted his influence
at the pontifical court to hush up the affair, and promised
to keep the duchess closer in future. He kept his word
but too well.</p>

<p>Calvin did not hesitate to take advantage of this
rescue; but from that moment we have no sufficient
data about him or his route. To find any traces of him,
we must examine local traditions, which ought not to
be despised, but which do not supply us with historical
certainty. It was natural—the map indicates it—that
the fugitive should turn his steps in the direction of
Modena. In the environs of that city there lived a celebrated
man of letters, Ludovico Castelvetro, who was
suspected of heresy. He was an esteemed critic and
skilful translator; he had rendered into Italian one of
Melanchthon's writings, and when he quitted Italy many
years after this, he passed through Geneva, where he
visited some friends. When the ancient villa of Castelvetro
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">{447}</a></span>
was pulled down in the first half of this century,
the workmen discovered a sealed chest, which contained
the earliest editions of Calvin's works in marvellous
preservation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_818" id="Ref_818" href="#Foot_818">[818]</a></span>
The reformer had no doubt heard this
scholar mentioned at the court of Ferrara; but there is
nothing to prove that he sought a temporary asylum
under the roof of Melanchthon's translator, who does not
appear to have made at that time a frank profession of
the Gospel.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_819" id="Ref_819" href="#Foot_819">[819]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S ROUTE.=</p>

<p>Tradition relates that Calvin, instead of going northwards
towards Switzerland, skirted the Apennines,
turned to the west, and reached the Val di Grana,
between Saluzzo and Coni, where he preached. It is
affirmed that the priests of the village of Carigliano so
excited the women of the parish, that with savage cries
they stoned the Frenchman out of the place. It is
added that Calvin went thence to Saluzzo, and preached
there, but with as little success.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_820" id="Ref_820" href="#Foot_820">[820]</a></span>
In our opinion, these
traditions are not sufficiently corroborated to deserve a
place in history. It seems more likely that Calvin took
the shortest road to Switzerland and made for the St.
Bernard pass. If he had possessed leisure for evangelical
excursions, he might no doubt have gone to the
Waldensian valleys, which his cousin Olivetan had visited,
and where the latter had conceived the project of
translating the Bible, at which he himself also labored
and was still to labor. But there is no indication of his
having ever visited those mountains. He arrived at the
city of Aosta.</p>

<p class="side">=THE CITY OF AOSTA.=</p>

<p>The first gleams of the Word of God were beginning,
as we have said, to enlighten that cisalpine region which
lies at the foot of the St. Bernard, Mont Blanc, and
Mont Rosa. Aosta, founded by Augustus, after whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">{448}</a></span>
it was named, had received an evangelical impulse from
Switzerland. The Bernese had thought that if the Divine
Word crossing the St. Gothard had made conquests near
the banks of the Ticino, it might make others in the
valley of Aosta by crossing the St. Bernard. Italian,
Bernese, and Genevan documents all bear witness alike
to the religious fermentation then prevailing in that city.
'The Gospel is spreading beyond the mountains,' wrote
Porral, the envoy of Geneva at Berne, 'and it must go
forward in despite of princes, for it is from God.' Ere
long the Roman hierarchy made use of their customary
weapons against those who embraced the Reform, and
Porral announced that the Aostans had 'serious questions
with their bishop, on account of the <i>excommunications</i>,
which they could not bear.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_821" id="Ref_821" href="#Foot_821">[821]</a></span>
We have told how the
Bernese plenipotentiaries went to Aosta in November
1535, to confer with the duke of Savoy. They pleaded
there in favor of Geneva, and demanded the liberation
of Saunier, then a prisoner at Pignerol.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_822" id="Ref_822" href="#Foot_822">[822]</a></span>
They talked
with everybody they met about the great questions then
under discussion, and invited them to receive the teaching
of Holy Scripture. Some dwellers in the valley, both
among the nobility and burghers, welcomed the principles
of the Reformation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_823" id="Ref_823" href="#Foot_823">[823]</a></span>
Among those won to the
Gospel were the Seigneurs De la Crète and De la
Visière, the pious and zealous Leonard de Vaudan,
Besenval, Tillier, Challans, Bovet, Borgnion, Philippon,
Gay, and others.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_824" id="Ref_824" href="#Foot_824">[824]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">{449}</a></div>

<p>But if there were hearts in the valley of Aosta ready
to receive the Gospel, there were others determined to
resist it. At the head of its opponents were two eminent
men. Among the laity was Count René de Challans,
marshal of Aosta, full of enthusiasm for popery and
feudalism, and bursting with contempt for the heretics
and republicans of Switzerland. Distressed at witnessing
the reverses suffered by his master, the duke of Savoy,
he had sworn that in Aosta at least he would exterminate
the Lutherans. His fellow-soldier in this crusade was
Pietro Gazzini, bishop of Aosta, one of the most famous
prelates of Italy. Priests and devotees extolled his
virtues and his learning, but what distinguished him
most was the haughty temper and domineering humor
which so often characterizes the priests of Rome.
Gazzini was a canon of the Lateran, the first patriarchal
church of the west, and served as the channel between
the duke and the pope. He was at Rome when evangelical
doctrine began to spread in his diocese, and he then
tried to manage that the council, which was to put an
end to heresy, should be held in the states of the duke
his master.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_825" id="Ref_825" href="#Foot_825">[825]</a></span>
He even carried his ambition for his
sovereign very far. 'It was becoming,' he told the
pontiff, 'that the direction of the council should be given
to the duke of Savoy by the emperor and the king of
France.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_826" id="Ref_826" href="#Foot_826">[826]</a></span>
The direction of a council given to a secular
prince by the pope and two other secular princes is an
idea apparently not in strict harmony with the theocratic
omnipotence of the pontiff, which many men boast of
so loudly.</p>

<p>In the bishop's absence there was a person at Aosta
quite worthy of supplying his place: this was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">{450}</a></span>
guardian of the Franciscan monastery, Antonio Savion
(Antonius de Sapientibus), a well-informed, zealous
man, who afterwards became general of the order, and
was one of the fathers of the Council of Trent. Savion
uttered a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>One day, when Gazzini was performing his duties in
the basilica of St. John, he received letters describing
the state of affairs at Aosta. The alarmed prelate did
not hesitate. 'When Calvin's heresy was penetrating
into his diocese,' said Besson, the Savoyard priest, 'he
hastened to block up the road.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_827" id="Ref_827" href="#Foot_827">[827]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the bishop arrived, he visited every parish
with indefatigable diligence; he went into the pulpits
and 'kept the people in sound doctrine by his sermons.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_828" id="Ref_828" href="#Foot_828">[828]</a></span>
He told them that 'Satan was prowling about, like a
roaring lion, to devour them; that they must therefore
keep a strict watch and drive back the ferocious beast.'
To these exhortations he added censures, monitions,
and excommunications. All readers of Holy Scripture
were to be driven from the fold of the church.</p>

<p>A general assembly of the Estates of the valley to
regulate the affairs of the district was held on the 21st
of February, 1536. Among the deputies were several
friends of the Reformation: De la Crète, Vaudan,
Borgnion, and others indicated in the <i>cahier</i> of the
Estates.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_829" id="Ref_829" href="#Foot_829">[829]</a></span>
Two subjects in particular filled the majority
of the assembly with anxiety. The political and the
religious situation of the city appeared equally threatened.
Men's eyes were turned to Switzerland, and it was asserted
that designs of political conquest were combined
in the minds of the Bernese with the too manifest desire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">{451}</a></span>
of religious conquest. At a time when the house of
Savoy was exposed to the attack of France, many
wanted to see the valley of Aosta take advantage of this
to join the Helvetic League and rally under the
standard of the Gospel. The members of the assembly
were convinced that the Swiss desired 'to canton' all
the country, and by that means extend their confederation
on both sides of the Alps. But the other danger
was still more alarming to the chiefs of the Roman
party, and they earnestly represented to the Estates
that the attachment of the city and valley to the holy
see of Rome was threatened; and that the Bernese
Lutherans, who were not content with laying hands
upon the territory of Vaud, but had introduced and
propagated their 'venomous sect,' wanted to do the
same in Aosta.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_830" id="Ref_830" href="#Foot_830">[830]</a></span>
The assembly resolved to maintain the
Roman-catholic faith and continue loyal to his ducal
highness, and it was enacted that every transgressor
should be put to death.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_831" id="Ref_831" href="#Foot_831">[831]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN AT AOSTA.=</p>

<p>It is a matter of notoriety that Calvin passed through
the city of Aosta; but did he arrive at this epoch, and
was he there during part at least of the session of the
Estates? This is affirmed by documents of the 17th
and 18th centuries, and his presence there is not impossible;
but there is, in our opinion, one circumstance
adverse to its acceptance. The official documents of
the period, and more especially the journals of the
assembly of February and March, 1536, make no
mention of Calvin's presence, and do not even allude to
it. It would, however, have been worth the trouble of
recording, if he were only designated, as he was a little
later in the Registers of Geneva, as <i>a Frenchman</i>. Two
important facts, in a religious point of view, occurred at
Aosta in the early months of the year 1536: the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">{452}</a></span>
Assembly of the Estates and the passage of Calvin.
The first took place in February and March; the
second probably a little later. Tradition makes them
coincide, which is more dramatic; history sets each in
its right place. But because the reformer did not
(during the sitting of the Assembly) play the part
assigned to him, it must not be assumed that he never
passed through that city.</p>

<p>Calvin had his reasons for taking the Aosta and
St. Bernard route. It had been in use for centuries,
and he had no doubt learnt during his residence at
Basle, what was universally known in Switzerland, that
the Bernese had frequent relations with this country,
that they had introduced the Gospel there, and that
some of the inhabitants had adopted the principles of
the Reformation. An ancient document gives us to
understand that Calvin passed through Aosta both
going and returning.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_832" id="Ref_832" href="#Foot_832">[832]</a></span>
In our opinion that would be
quite natural. The reports circulated in Switzerland
about that city would induce him to take that road on
his way to Italy, and we can easily conceive, as regards
his return, that a fugitive would take a road already
known to him, and where he was sure of meeting
friends. But we do not press this, and are content to
follow the traces Calvin left in the country on his return,
and which are still to be found there.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S FARM.=</p>

<p>At the foot of the St. Bernard, very near the city of
Aosta, stood a house on some rising ground, where a
grange may still be seen. In order to reach it you
leave the St. Bernard road a short distance from the
city and take a footpath, near which a little chapel now
stands. The meadows around it, the abrupt peaks
rising above it, the Alps hiding their snowy heads in
the clouds, the view over Aosta and the valley—all
combined to give a picturesque aspect to that house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">{453}</a></span>
If the traveller asks the inhabitants of the country what
house that is, he will be told it is 'Calvin's Farm;' and
they add that when the reformer was passing through
Aosta, he was sheltered there by one of the most zealous
of the reformed, Leonard de Vaudan. It was very
natural that Calvin should prefer such a retired habitation
to a house in the city.</p>

<p>We do not know what Calvin did or said at Aosta.
The only fact which appears proved—and a monument
more than three centuries old attests it—is that his presence
did not remain unknown, and caused a sensation
there more or less lively. The reformer would have
run great danger had he been arrested in the city of
Bishop Gazzini, 'who by his vehement discourses was
arming all his flock against the heretics, and who, seeing
Satan incarnate in the evangelical teachers, called upon
them to expel the ravenous beast.' Such are the expressions
made use of by the historian of the diocese.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_833" id="Ref_833" href="#Foot_833">[833]</a></span>
Calvin, already a fugitive, hastened to leave the neighborhood
of the city. To these simple and natural facts
some extraordinary circumstances have been added.
For instance, certain writers have represented the Count
of Challans in fierce pursuit of Calvin, and following
him with drawn sword into the very heart of the
mountains. This is a legend tacked on to history, as
happens far too frequently.</p>

<p>It was natural that Calvin, under the circumstances
in which he was placed, should not take the ordinary
road, as it was certain he would be looked for there, and
he might easily have been overtaken. It would appear,
if we follow the traces his passage has left round Aosta,
that he sought to escape from the enemies of the
Reformation. When we leave 'Calvin's Farm,' and turn
to the right, we come to a bridge near Roisan, below
the village of Closelina. This is called in the neighborhood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">{454}</a></span>
'Calvin's Bridge.' Calvin crossed it, and thus
followed a more difficult and less frequented road than
the St. Bernard. If we climb the mountain in the
direction of the valley of La Valpeline, we arrive at a
col inclosed by Mont Balme, Mont Combin, and Mont
Vélan: this is the 'pass of the window,' afterwards
named 'Calvin's Window,' and by it the reformer entered
Switzerland again.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_834" id="Ref_834" href="#Foot_834">[834]</a></span></p>

<p>As we have said, Calvin's passage had made a deep
impression in Aosta. The inhabitants of that most
catholic city looked upon their opposition to the reformer,
and the flight to which they compelled him to
have recourse, as a glory to their city calculated to
bring upon them the admiration of the friends of the
papacy. Consequently, five years after these events, on
the 14th May, 1541, the Aostans erected a stone cross
in the middle of their city in memory of the act. As
this primitive monument had become decayed, it was
replaced two centuries later (1741) by a column eight
feet high, which Senebier mentions, and on which there
was this inscription:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_835" id="Ref_835" href="#Foot_835">[835]</a></span></p>

<p class="center small smc">'Hanc Calvini fuga erexit anno MDXLI.<br />
Religionis constantia reparavit MDCCXLI.'</p>

<p>Finally, a hundred years later, this was succeeded by
the monument, which every traveller can now see as he
passes through Aosta, and which we have examined
more than once ourselves.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_836" id="Ref_836" href="#Foot_836">[836]</a></span>
There are thus three
centuries and three successive monuments. Calvin's
passage through the city of Aosta is, therefore, among
the number of historic facts commemorated on the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">{455}</a></span>
spot where they occurred, in the most peremptory
manner.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN RETURNS TO FRANCE.=</p>

<p>Calvin passed through Switzerland, halted at Basle,
and thence proceeded to Strasburg. He determined to
choose one of these two cities, in which to pass that
studious and peaceful life he desired so much, either in
the society of Cop, Gryneus, and Myconius, or of Bucer,
Capito, and Hedio. But he desired first to return to
Noyon, where he had some business to arrange. Leaving
Du Tillet at Strasburg, he started for France, which he
could do without imprudence; for he had not left
his country under the weight of any judicial sentence
which he had evaded. Moreover the government just
then was less severe.</p>

<p>The arrival of the young doctor was no sooner known
in Paris than many friends of the Gospel hastened to
his inn. They were never tired of listening to him.
'There is not in all France,' they told him, 'a man who
inspires us with so much admiration as you do.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_837" id="Ref_837" href="#Foot_837">[837]</a></span></p>

<p>But Calvin was eager to reach Noyon, where a severe
disappointment awaited him: his brother Charles, the
chaplain, was no more.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_838" id="Ref_838" href="#Foot_838">[838]</a></span>
The circumstances of his death
filled Calvin with sorrow and with joy. 'Charles openly
confessed Jesus Christ on his dying bed,' his surviving
brother, Anthony, and his sister Mary told John, 'and
desired no other absolution than that obtained from God
by faith. Accordingly, the exasperated priests had him
buried by night, between the four pillars of the gallows.'</p>

<p>Calvin invited Anthony and Mary to leave a country
in which believers were covered with infamy.</p>

<p>His stay at Noyon was very short. It was not possible
for him to go direct to Basle or Strasburg, because
of the war between Charles V. and Francis I., which
prevented his crossing Champagne and Lorraine; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">{456}</a></span>
he learnt that he could, without encountering any difficulty,
pass through Bresse, then ascend the Rhone, traverse
Geneva, and so reach Basle by way of Lausanne
and Berne. He took this road. 'In all this,' says
Beza, 'God was his guide.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_839" id="Ref_839" href="#Foot_839">[839]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus drew near to Geneva the great theologian who
discerned more clearly than any other man of that day
what, in doctrine and in life, was in conformity with or
opposed to God's truth and will. Whereas his predecessors
had left some few traditions existing by the
side of Scripture, he laid bare the rock of the Word.
Truth had become the sole passion of that ardent and
inflexible soul, and he was resolved to dedicate his
whole life to it. At that time, however, he had no idea
of performing a work like Luther's; and if he had been
shown the career that was opening before him, he would
have shrunk from it with terror. 'I will try to earn my
living in a private station,' he said.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_840" id="Ref_840" href="#Foot_840">[840]</a></span>
The ambition of
Francis I. changed everything. That prince, unwittingly,
accomplished the designs of God, who desired to
place the reformer in the centre of Europe, between
Italy, Germany, and France.</p>

 <span style="font-size:80%">CALVIN'S ARRIVAL AT GENEVA.<br />
 (<span class="smc">Summer, 1536.</span>)</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="side">=CALVIN ARRIVES AT GENEVA.=</p>

<p><span class="smc">One</span> evening in the month of July, 1536, a carriage
from France arrived at Geneva. A man, still young,
alighted from it. He was short, thin, and pale; his
beard was black and pointed, his organization weak,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">{457}</a></span>
and his frame somewhat worn by study; but in his high
forehead, lively and severe eyes, regular and expressive
features, there were indications of a profound spirit,
an elevated soul, and an indomitable character. His
intention was to 'pass through Geneva hastily, without
stopping more than one night in the city.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_841" id="Ref_841" href="#Foot_841">[841]</a></span>
He was
accompanied by a man and woman of about the same
age. The three travellers belonged to the same family—two
brothers and a sister. The foremost of them,
long accustomed to keep himself in the background,
desired to pass through Geneva unobserved. He inquired
for an inn where he could spend the night: his
voice was mild, and his manner attractive. Scarcely a
carriage arrived from France without being surrounded
by some of the Genevans, or at least by French refugees;
for it might bring new fugitives, obliged to seek a
country in which they were free to profess the doctrine
of Christ. A young Frenchman, at that time the friend
and disciple of the traveller, who had gone to the place
where the carriage from France put up, in order to see
if it brought anybody whom he knew, recognized the
man with the intelligent face, and conducted him to an
hotel. The traveller was John Calvin, and his friend
was Louis Du Tillet, ex-canon of Angoulême, Calvin's
travelling companion during his Italian journey. From
Strasburg, whither he had gone to meet Calvin, he had
returned to Geneva, no doubt because he thought that
the war between Francis I. and Charles V. would compel
his friend to make a bend and pass through Bresse and
the valley of the Leman. This was actually what
happened.</p>

<p>Calvin, who had come to Geneva without a plan and
even against his will, having sat down with Du Tillet in
his room at the hotel, their conversation naturally
turned on the city in which they were, and of which the
reformer know but little. He learnt, either from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">{458}</a></span>
friend or from others subsequently, what he probably
knew something about already; namely, that popery
had been driven out of it shortly before; that the zeal,
struggles, trials, and evangelical labors of William Farel
were incessant; but that affairs were not yet 'put in
order in the city;' that there were dangerous divisions,
and that Farel was contending almost alone for the
triumph of the Gospel. Calvin had long respected
Farel as the most zealous of evangelists; but it does not
appear that they had ever met. Du Tillet could not
keep to himself the news of his friend's arrival, and
after leaving Calvin, he called on Master William.
'After discovering me, he made my coming known to
others,' says Calvin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_842" id="Ref_842" href="#Foot_842">[842]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=FAREL AND CALVIN.=</p>

<p>Farel, who had read the <i>Christian Institutes</i>, had
recognized in the author of that work the most eminent
genius, the most scriptural theologian, and the most
eloquent writer of the age. The thought that this
extraordinary man was in Geneva, and that he could
see and hear him, moved and delighted Farel. He
went with all haste to the inn and entered into conversation
with the youthful theologian. Everything confirmed
him in his former opinion. He had long been
looking for a servant of God to help him, yet had never
thought of Calvin. But now a flash of light shone into
his soul, an inward voice said to him: This is the man
of God you are seeking. 'At the very moment when I
was thinking least about it,' he said, 'the grace of God
led me to him.' From that moment there was no
hesitation or delay. 'Farel, who glowed with a marvellous
zeal for promoting the Gospel,' says Calvin,
'made every effort to retain me.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_843" id="Ref_843" href="#Foot_843">[843]</a></span></p>

<p>Would he succeed? Seldom has there been a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">{459}</a></span>
who, like Calvin, was placed in the influential position
he was to occupy all his life, not only without his concurrence
but even against his will. 'Stay with me,'
said Farel, 'and help me. There is work to be done in
this city.' Calvin replied with astonishment: 'Excuse
me, I cannot stop here more than one night.'—'Why do
you seek elsewhere for what is now offered you?' replied
Farel; 'why refuse to edify the Church of Geneva by
your faith, zeal, and knowledge?' The appeal was
fruitless: to undertake so great a task seemed to Calvin
impossible. 'But Farel, inspired by the spirit of a hero,'
says Theodore Beza, 'would not be discouraged.' He
pointed out to the stranger that as the Reformation had
been miraculously established in Geneva, it ought not
to be abandoned in a cowardly manner; that if he did
not take the part offered to him in this task, the work
might probably perish, and he would be the cause of the
ruin of the Church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_844" id="Ref_844" href="#Foot_844">[844]</a></span>
Calvin could not make up his
mind; he did not want to bind himself to a particular
church; he told his new friend that he preferred travelling
in search of knowledge, and making himself useful
in the places where he chanced to halt. 'Look
first at the place in which you are now,' answered
Farel; 'popery has been driven out and traditions
abolished, and now the doctrine of the Scriptures must
be taught here.' 'I cannot <i>teach</i>,' exclaimed Calvin;
'on the contrary, I have need to <i>learn</i>. There are
special labors for which I wish to reserve myself. This
city cannot afford me the leisure that I require.'</p>

<p>He explained his plan. He wanted to go to Strasburg,
to Bucer, and Capito, and then putting himself
in communication with the other doctors of Germany,
to increase his knowledge by continued study. 'Study!
leisure! knowledge!' said Farel. 'What! must we
never <i>practise</i>? I am sinking under my task; pray
help me.' The young doctor had still other reasons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">{460}</a></span>
His constitution was weak. 'The frail state of my
health needs rest,' he said.—'Rest!' exclaimed Farel,
'death alone permits the soldiers of Christ to rest
from their labors.' Calvin certainly did not mean
to do nothing. He would labor, but each man labors
according to the gift he has received: he would defend
the Reformation not by his deeds but by words.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_845" id="Ref_845" href="#Foot_845">[845]</a></span></p>

<p>The reformer had not yet expressed his whole
thought: it was not only the work they asked him to
undertake that frightened him, it was also the locality
in which he would have to carry it out. He did not
feel himself strong enough to bear the combat he
would have to engage in. He shrank from appearing
before the assemblies of Geneva. The violence, the
tumults, the indomitable temper of the Genevese were
much talked of, and they intimidated and alarmed him.
To this Farel replied, 'that the severer the disease,
the stronger the measures to be employed to cure it.'
The Genevese storm, it is true; they burst out like a
squall of wind in a gale; but was that a reason for leaving
him, Farel, alone to meet these furious tempests?
'I entreat you,' said the intrepid evangelist, 'to take
your share. These matters are harder than death.'
The burden was too heavy for his shoulders; he wanted
the help of a younger man. But the young man of
Noyon was surprised that <i>he</i> should be thought of.
'I am timid and naturally pusillanimous,' he said.
'How can I withstand such roaring waves?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_846" id="Ref_846" href="#Foot_846">[846]</a></span>
At
this Farel could not restrain a feeling of anger and
almost of contempt. 'Ought the servants of Jesus
Christ to be so delicate,' he exclaimed, 'as to be frightened
at warfare?'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_847" id="Ref_847" href="#Foot_847">[847]</a></span>
This blow touched the young
reformer to the heart. <i>He</i> frightened!—<i>he</i> prefer his
own ease to the service of the Saviour! His conscience
was troubled and his feelings were violently agitated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">{461}</a></span>
But his great humility still held him back: he had a
deep sentiment of his incapacity for the kind of work
they wanted him to undertake. 'I beg of you, in God's
name,' he exclaimed, 'to have pity on me! Leave me
to serve Him in another way than what you desire.'</p>

<p class="side">=THE IMPRECATION.=</p>

<p>Farel, seeing that neither prayers nor exhortations
could avail with Calvin, reminded him of a frightful example
of disobedience similar to his own. 'Jonah, also,'
he said, 'wanted to flee from the presence of the Lord,
but <i>the Lord cast him into the sea</i>.' The struggle in the
young doctor's heart became more keen. He was
violently shaken, like an oak assailed by the tempest;
he bent before the blast, and rose up again, but a last
gust, more impetuous than all the others, was shortly
about to uproot him. The emotion of the elder of the
two speakers had gradually increased, in proportion as
the young man's had also increased. Farel's heart was
hot within him. At that supreme moment, feeling as if
inspired by the Spirit of God, he raised his hand towards
heaven and exclaimed: 'You are thinking only of your
tranquillity, you care for nothing but your studies. Be
it so. In the name of Almighty God, I declare that if
you do not answer to His summons, He will not bless
your plans.' Then, perceiving that the critical moment
had come, he added an 'alarming adjuration' to his
declaration: he even ventured on an imprecation.
Fixing his eyes of fire on the young man, and placing
his hands on the head of his victim, he exclaimed in his
voice of thunder: 'May God curse your repose! may
God curse your studies, if in such a great necessity as
ours you withdraw and refuse to give us help and
support!'</p>

<p>At these words, the young doctor, whom Farel had
for some time kept on the rack, trembled. He shook in
every limb; he felt that Farel's words did not proceed
from himself: God was there, the holiness of the presence
of Jehovah laid strong hold of his mind; <i>he saw</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">{462}</a></span>
<i>Him who is invisible</i>. It appeared to him, he said, 'that
the hand of God was stretched down from heaven, that
it lay hold of him, and fixed him irrevocably to the
place he was so impatient to leave.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_848" id="Ref_848" href="#Foot_848">[848]</a></span>
He could not free
himself from that terrible grasp. Like Lot's wife when
she looked back on her tranquil home, he was rooted to
his seat, powerless to move. At last he raised his head
and peace returned to his soul; he had yielded, he
had sacrificed the studies he loved so well, he had laid
his Isaac on the altar, he consented <i>to lose his life to save
it</i>. His conscience, now convinced, made him surmount
every obstacle in order that he might obey. That heart,
so faithful and sincere, gave itself, and gave itself for
ever. Seeing that what was required of him was God's
pleasure, says Farel, he did violence to himself, adding:
'And he did more, and that more promptly, than any one
else could have done.'</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S SUBMISSION.=</p>

<p>The call of Calvin in Geneva is perhaps, after that of
St. Paul, the most remarkable to be found in the history
of the Church. It was not miraculous, like that of the
Apostle on the road to Damascus; and yet in the
chamber of that inn, there was the flash of light and the
roar as of thunder; the voice which the Lord made to
sound in Calvin's heart, terrified him, broke down his
obstinacy, and prostrated him as if a thunderbolt from
heaven had struck him. His heart had been pierced;
he had bowed his head with humility, and almost
prostrate on the earth he had felt that he could no
longer fight against God and kick against the pricks.
At the same time confidence in God filled his soul.
He knew that He who made him feel those 'stings'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_849" id="Ref_849" href="#Foot_849">[849]</a></span>
had a sovereign remedy calculated to heal all his wounds.
Has not God said, 'Commit thy way unto the Lord,
and He shall bring it to pass?' The young man desired
no longer to run restive like a fiery courser, but, 'like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">{463}</a></span>
docile steed, permit himself to be guided peaceably by
the hand of his Master.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_850" id="Ref_850" href="#Foot_850">[850]</a></span></p>

<p>From that hour the propagation and defence of truth
became the sole passion of his life, and to them he consecrated
all the powers of his heart. He had still, after
this solemn hour, to undergo, as he says, 'great anxiety,
sorrow, tears, and distress.' But his resolution was
taken. He belonged to himself no longer, but to God.
'In everything and in every place he would guide himself
entirely by his obedience.' He never forgot the
fearful adjuration which Farel had employed. He had
not set himself (he thought) in the place he occupied,
but had been put there by the arm of the Almighty.
Hence, whenever he met with obstacles, he called to
mind 'the hand stretched down from heaven,' and
knowing its sovereign power, he took courage.</p>

<p>The reformer did not, however, stop at Geneva immediately.
On leaving France, he had undertaken to
accompany one of his relations, named Artois, to Basle.
For some days the brethren of Geneva refused to let
him go. At last, seeing that Calvin was decided, they
confined themselves to extorting from him an engagement
to return; after which he started for Basle with
his relation. On the road he encountered fresh
importunities; the Churches, whom the author of the
<i>Christian Institutes</i> saluted on his journey, desired to
detain him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_851" id="Ref_851" href="#Foot_851">[851]</a></span>
Whether these entreaties, on which
Calvin had not reckoned before setting out, proceeded
from Lausanne, Neuchâtel, Berne, or rather from some
other and younger Churches, it is hard to say. At last
he arrived at Basle, and having finished his business
returned to Geneva, probably in the latter half of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">{464}</a></span>
month of August. But he had no sooner arrived than
his delicate health was shaken; he suffered from a
severe cold, and was ill for nine days.</p>

<p class="side">=CALVIN'S VOCATION.=</p>

<p>When Calvin recovered from his indisposition, he at
once set about the work for which he had been detained.
As he would have a crowd of hearers—men and women,
old and young, Genevese and strangers—the cathedral
of St. Pierre was assigned him. It was in that vast
building, where the mass had been so often sung, that
Calvin was about to inaugurate the reign of Holy
Scripture. The gates of St. Pierre's opened; the frail
and humble, but powerful preacher entered the Gothic
portal; a numerous crowd made their way with him
into the nave, whose majestic grandeur seemed to harmonize
so well with the new teaching that was about to
be heard in it; and soon his voice resounded under those
time-honored arches.</p>

<p>Calvin, coming after Luther and Farel, was called
to complete the work of both. The mighty Luther,
to whom will always belong the first place in the work
of the Reformation, had uttered the words of faith
with power; Calvin was to systematize them, and show
the imposing unity of the evangelical doctrine. The
impetuous Farel, the most active missionary of the
epoch, had detached men from Romish errors, and
had united many to Christ, but without combining
them; Calvin was to reunite these scattered members
and constitute the assembly. Possessed of an organizing
genius, he accomplished the task which God had
assigned him: he undertook to form a church placed
under the direction of the Word of God and the discipline
of the Holy Ghost. In his opinion, this ought
to be—not, as at Rome, the hierarchical institution of
a legal religion; nor, as with the mystics, a vague
ideal; nor, as with the rationalists, an intellectual and
moral society without religious life. It is said of the
Word, which was God, and which was made flesh: <i>In</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">{465}</a></span>
<i>Him was life</i>. Life must, therefore, be the essential
characteristic of the people that it was to form. Spiritual
powers must—so Calvin thought—act in the midst
of the flock of Jesus Christ. It was not ideas only that
the Lord communicated to His disciples, but a divine
life. 'In the kingdom of Christ,' he said, 'all that we
need care for is the <i>new man</i>.'</p>

<p>And this was not a mere theory: Calvin must see
it put into action. Not content with the reformation
of the faith, he will combat that decline of morality
which has for so long filled courts, cities, and monasteries
with disorder. He will call for the conversion
of the heart and holiness of life; he will interdict luxury,
drunkenness, blasphemy, impurity, masquerades,
and gambling, which the Roman Church had tolerated.</p>

<p>This strictness of discipline has brought down severe
reproaches on the reformer. We must confess that if
Calvin did take a false step, it was here. He conceded
to man, to the magistrate, too great a share in the correction
of morals and doctrine: in the sixteenth century
the intervention of the State in the discipline of the
Church disturbed the only truly salutary action of the
Word of God. Calvin cleansed with pure water the
gold and silver of the tabernacle, but left on it <i>one</i> spot—the
employment of the civil arm. We must not,
however, accuse him more than justice permits. He
had to suffer from this action of the temporal power
much more than he employed it. Since 1532 the Genevese
government had set itself in the place of the bishop.
We have seen its orders to preach the Gospel without
any admixture of human doctrines. A little later it
organized the grand disputation, demanded by Bernard,
and presided over it as judge. Did it not even go so far
as to remove from the people of Thiez the excommunication
pronounced by the bishop? Elsewhere we have
described how in the Swiss cantons, and especially at
Zurich and Berne, the magistrates did the same. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">{466}</a></span>
intervention of temporal authority proceeded from the
temporal power. The Council of Geneva had no intention
of permitting a strange minister, a young man of
Noyon, to deprive them of prerogatives to which they
clung strongly. They claimed the right to regulate
almost everything by their decrees—from the highest
things, the profession of faith, the regulation of worship,
and the government of the church, down to women's
dress. Calvin often protested against those pretensions,
and on this point his whole life was one long
struggle. Far from blaming the reformer for certain
regulations he was obliged to permit, we should praise
him for the firmness with which he maintained, more
than any other teacher of the sixteenth century, the
great principles of the distinction between what is
temporal and what is spiritual.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_852" id="Ref_852" href="#Foot_852">[852]</a></span></p>

<p class="side">=RESULTS OF HIS TEACHING.=</p>

<p>But he contributed still more forcibly by his direct
teaching to scatter the seeds of a true and wise liberty
among the new generations. Doubtless the sources of
modern civilization are manifold. Many men of different
vocations and genius have labored at this great work;
but it is just to acknowledge the place that Calvin
occupies among them. The purity and force of his
morality were the most powerful means of liberating
men and nations from the abuses which had been everywhere
introduced, and from the despotic vexations
under which they groaned. A nation weak in its morals
is easily enslaved. But he did more. How great the
truths, how important the principles that Calvin has
proclaimed! He fearlessly attacked the papacy, <i>by
which all liberty is oppressed</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_853" id="Ref_853" href="#Foot_853">[853]</a></span>
and which during so
many centuries had kept the human mind in bondage;
and broke the chains which everywhere fettered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">{467}</a></span>
thoughts of man. He boldly asserted 'that there
is <i>a very manifest distinction</i> between the spiritual
and the political or civil governments.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_854" id="Ref_854" href="#Foot_854">[854]</a></span>
He did more
than this: the aim of his whole life was to restore the
supremacy of conscience. He endeavored to re-establish
the kingdom of God in man, and succeeded in doing so
not only with men of genius, but with a great number
of obscure persons. These were the men who, resolving
to obey God above all things, were able to resist the
instruments of the pope, the Valois, Philip II., Alva, and
their imitators. While maintaining their liberty as regards
faith, those noble disciples of the Gospel—men
such as Knox, Marnix de Sainte-Aldegonde, and a
multitude of other Christian heroes—learnt to maintain
it in earthly matters.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_855" id="Ref_855" href="#Foot_855">[855]</a></span>
Such was the principal gate by
which the different liberties have entered the world.</p>

<p>Calvin did not confine himself to theories: he pronounced
frankly against the despotism of kings and the
despotism of the people. He declared that 'if princes
<i>usurp any portion of God's authority</i>, we must not obey
them;'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_856" id="Ref_856" href="#Foot_856">[856]</a></span>
and that if the people indulge in acts of mad
violence, we should rather perish than submit to them.
'God has not armed you,' he said, 'that you may resist
those who are set over you by Him as governors. You
cannot expect He will protect you, if you undertake
what He disavows.'<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_857" id="Ref_857" href="#Foot_857">[857]</a></span>
Nevertheless Calvin taught men
to love such eternal blessings, and said that it was
better to die than to be deprived of them. '<i>God's honor</i>,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">{468}</a></span>
he declared, '<i>is more precious than your life</i>.' And from
that hour we see those in the Netherlands and elsewhere,
who had learnt at Geneva to maintain freedom of conscience,
acquiring such a love for liberty that they
claimed it also for the State, sought it for themselves,
and endeavored to give it to others. Religious liberty
has been, and is still, the mother of every kind of
liberty; but in our days we witness a strange sight.
Many of those who owe their emancipation in great
part to Calvin, have lost all recollection of it, and some
of them insult the noble champion who made them
free.</p>

<p>Still, the establishment of temporal liberty was not the
reformer's object: it flows only from his principles, as
water from a spring. To proclaim the salvation of God,
to establish the right of God—these are the things to
which he devoted his life, and that work he pursued with
unalterable firmness. He knows the resistance that men
will oppose to him: but that shall not check his march.
He will batter down ramparts, bridge over chasms, and
unflinchingly trample under foot the barriers which he
knows are opposed to the glory of God and the welfare
of man. Calvin has a correct, penetrating, and sure eye,
and his glance takes in a wide horizon. He resists not
only the chief enemy, popery, but generously opposes
those who seem to be on his side and pretend to support
him: there is no acceptance of persons with him. He
discerns manifold and grave errors hidden under the
cloak of reform—errors which would destroy from its
foundation the edifice to whose building, those who
teach them, pretend to give their help. Whilst many
allow themselves to be surprised, he discovers the small
cloud rising from the sea; he sees the skies are about to
be darkened and filled with storms, thunder, and rain.
At the sight of these tempests he neither bends nor hides
his head: on the contrary, he raises it boldly. 'We
are called,' he says, 'to difficult battles; but far from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">{469}</a></span>
being astonished and growing timid, we take courage,
and commit our own body to the deadly struggle.'</p>

<p>That man had occasioned astonishment at first by his
youthful air and the weakness of his constitution; but
he had no sooner spoken than he rose in the eyes of all
who heard him. He grew taller and taller, he towered
above their heads. Every man presaged in him one of
those mighty intelligences which carry nations with them,
gain battles, found empires, discover worlds, reform religion,
and transform society.</p>

<p>Calvin teaches in Geneva, he writes to those far beyond
its walls. And ere long we see something new
forming in the world. A great work had been commenced
by the heroic Luther, who had a successor
worthy of him to complete it. Calvin gives to the Reformation
what the pope affirms it does not possess.
There is a noise and a shaking, and the dry bones meet
together. The breath comes from the four winds, the
dead live and stand upon their feet, an exceeding great
army. The Church of Christ has reappeared upon earth.
From the bosom of that little city goes forth the word
of life. France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany,
England, Scotland, and other countries hear it. A
century later, that same word, borne by pious refugees
or faithful missionaries, shall become the glory and
strength of the New World. Later still, it shall visit the
most distant isles and continents; it shall fill the earth
with the knowledge of the Lord, and shall gather
together more and more the dispersed families of the
world round the cross of Christ in a holy and living
unity.</p>

<p class="side">=A COUNCIL MINUTE.=</p>

<p>On the 5th of September, 1536, the Council of Geneva
ordered these words to be written in their public
registers:</p>

<p>'<i>Master William Farel explains that the lecture which
that Frenchman had begun at St. Pierre's was necessary;
wherefore he prayed that they would consider about retaining</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">{470}</a></span>
<i>him and providing for his support. Upon which it was
resolved to provide for his maintenance.</i>'</p>

<p>On the 15th of February, 1537, they gave six crowns
of the sun, and afterwards a cloth coat, to 'that Frenchman'
recently arrived, and whose name it would seem
they did not know.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_858" id="Ref_858" href="#Foot_858">[858]</a></span>
Such are the modest notices of the
young man in the public records of the city which received
him. In a few years that name was sounded all
over the world; and in our time a celebrated historian—impartial
in the question, as he does not belong to the
churches of the Reformation—has said: 'In order that
French protestantism [we might say "protestantism" in
general] should have a character and doctrine, it needed
a city to serve as a centre, and a chief to become its
organizer. <i>That city was Geneva, and that chief was
Calvin.</i>'<span

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
